<<frontm_split_004.html_page_9>>*Guide to Pronunciation*

Sanskrit vowels are pronounced very much like Italian vowels, with the
exception of the short /a/, which is pronounced like the /u/ in the
English word ‘but': long /ā/ is pronounced like the /a/ in ‘father'.

As for the consonants a reasonable approximation will be obtained by
pronouncing /c/ as in ‘church', /j/ as in ‘jungle', /ṣ/ as in ‘shun',
/s/ as in ‘sun', /ś/ as something halfway between the other two s's.

The aspirated consonants should be pronounced distinctly; /bh/ as in
‘cab-horse', /dh/ as in ‘mad-house', /gh/ as in ‘dog-house', /ph/ as in
‘top-hat', and /th/ as in ‘goat-herd'. /ṛ/ is a vowel, pronounced
midway between ‘ri' as in ‘rivet' and ‘er' as in ‘father'.

               *Chaos out of Order*

Turning and turning in the widening gyre\\
The falcon cannot hear the falconer;\\
Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;\\
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,\\
The blood-dimmed tide is loosed...

WILLIAM BUTLER YEATS, /The Second Coming/ (1921)

Nothing of him that doth fade\\
But doth suffer a sea-change\\
Into something rich and strange.

WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE, /The Tempest/ (1611--12)

EVERY Hindu myth is different; all Hindu myths are alike. In spite of
the deep-seated, totally compelling world-view that moulds every image
and symbol, every word and idea of any Hindu myth, in spite of the
stress placed upon traditional form at the expense of the individual
artist, each myth celebrates the belief that the universe is boundlessly
various, that everything occurs simultaneously, that all possibilities
may exist without excluding each other. This concept is consciously
expressed in at least one myth (myth 9 of this collection, p.
[[#chapter1.html#page_46][46]]): the creatures that the lord created
were ‘harmful or benign, gentle or cruel, full of /dharma/ or /adharma/,
truthful or false. And when they are created again, they will have these
qualities; and this pleased him. The lord Creator himself diversified
the variety and differentiation of all the objects of the senses,
properties, and forms.'

<<frontm1.html_page_12>>In making the present selection, I have tried to
give the reader as varied a taste of this delicious repast as possible:
indeed, at times I fear the mixture may be a bit too rich and highly
spiced for the unsuspecting browser, for Hindu mythology is a feast
perhaps better suited to the gourmand than to the gourmet. Yet in spite
of all attempts to preserve this essential variety, the pattern of the
mythology has emerged and reasserted itself. The more myths one
encounters, the more the basic themes seem to be reinforced; no matter
what direction one sets out in, one is drawn back again and again to
this centre of gravity, the still centre, the eye of the storm, just as
Alice found herself always walking back in at the door of the Looking
Glass House no matter what part of the magic garden she had hoped to
reach.

The content of this pattern is merely another aspect of the form out of
which it emerges, the tension between variety and pattern: the
resolution of chaos into order, and its dissolution back into chaos. The
reader will note that most of the myths in this collection are about
birth or death, usually about both; this preponderance does not merely
reflect the tastes of the translator, nor the peculiarities of Hinduism,
but is basic to the concerns of mythology everywhere. The way that the
Hindu myths deal with these basic concerns, however, is not so universal
and merits closer scrutiny.

It is almost a truism in most mythologies that the act of creation is
the process of developing order out of chaos. This traditionalist view
that reveres order and fears chaos is mirrored in Yeats's famous
description of a destructive anarchy: ‘Things fall apart; the centre
cannot hold.' One may even point out -- recalling Yeats's love of Indian
mythology -- the Hindu symbolism of the falcon (myth 73, p.
[[#chapter7.html#page_281][281]]) and the blood-dimmed tide of the
doomsday flood (myth 51, p. [[#chapter5.html#page_183][183]]).
Traditional Hindu philosophy accepted these values, which can be
detected at the heart of several of the creation
<<frontm1.html_page_13>>myths translated here; the Hindu universe is a
closed system, a ‘world-egg' with a rigid shell, so that nothing is ever
‘created' /ex nihilo/; rather, things are constantly rearranged, each
put in its proper place, and by doing this -- propping apart heaven and
earth, distinguishing male from female, separating the classes of
mankind on earth -- ordered life emerges out of lifeless chaos. Thus the
disparate energies of the gods are combined and reintegrated in order to
create the chariot of Śiva (myth 37, pp.
[[#chapter4.html#page_131][131--2]]) or the Goddess herself (myth 64, p.
[[#chapter6.html#page_241][241]]).

But against this Apollonian structure there flows another, Dionysian,
current in Indian thought, which views the act of creation as the
transformation of order into chaos. Only when living creatures are in
conflict -- the gentle against the cruel, the truthful against the false
-- only when the powers of evil are allowed to rise up against the
powers of good (albeit only to be inevitably, if temporarily, quelled),
only when death exists to threaten life, can life realize its full
value. This philosophy is reflected in Freud's discussion of the
pleasure and pain principle: the death instinct, Thanatos, seeks always
to regress to an earlier stage when all was in perfect order, before
disintegration and differentiation took place, but the life principle,
Eros, strives forward into further chaos.

The orthodox, Apollonian, order-oriented Hindu view of time regards the
Golden Age, the Kṛta Yuga, as having occurred in the distant past, and
tries to recapture it. Similarly, classical Indian philosophy has always
followed the Thanatos principle and rejected the principle of Eros; the
ideal state, the goal, is the reintegration of the self into the perfect
whole, the ‘release' of the individual life force from the debasing
influence of the senses so that it may be reabsorbed into the
un-differentiated godhead. This is the ‘blowing out of the flame'
(/nirvāņa/). But the force of mythology often goes directly against the
grain of philosophy, revering the flame of life
<<frontm1.html_page_14>>more than the ocean of release. Although the
tenets of classical Indian philosophy often form the basis from which
the Hindu myths depart, the myths do in fact depart and range far
afield; myth carefully builds up the assumptions of philosophy only to
tear them down with equal care, like Penelope unravelling at night what
she had woven by day.

‘Things fall apart' -- this state of chaos in the myths is no longer a
threat to life but the only premiss on which life can take place. Things
fall apart when the primeval Man is dismembered -- and the human race is
created (myth 2, pp. [[#chapter1.html#page_27][27--8]]); things fall
apart when Satī's corpse is torn limb from limb -- and her shrines
appear on earth (myth 67, p. [[#chapter6.html#page_251][251]]); things
fall apart when Agni is distributed among plants and animals, giving
fire to mankind (myths 30--32, pp. [[#chapter3.html#page_99][99--104]]),
or when Śiva's fever is dispersed so that it will not destroy the
universe (myth 35, p. [[#chapter4.html#page_122][122]]). Things fall
apart when the seed of Agni is divided, or the Six Embryos are divided,
in order to give birth to Skanda (myth 33, p.
[[#chapter3.html#page_110][110]]) or Kṛṣņa (myth 57, pp.
[[#chapter5.html#page_207][207--11]]). The disintegration into primal
elements which appears to signify death is in fact the first step of the
life transformation; that which seems to ‘fade' actually undergoes
Shakespeare's ‘sea-change into something rich and strange'. For the sea
is the womb of the Hindu universe, and to return to the womb is to die.
The cosmic waters are the ultimate undifferentiated form of order --
death. But when the ocean is churned into chaos (myth 72, pp.
[[#chapter7.html#page_275][275--8]]), the life forces -- good and evil,
ambrosia and poison -- undergo their sea-change and are set free.

*Problems and Methods*

*SOURCES*

The major sources of Hindu mythology in the ancient and medieval periods
are a series of texts composed in Sanskrit, an
<<frontm1.html_page_15>>Indo-European language closely related to Greek
and Latin. The earliest source -- and, indeed, the earliest known
Indo-European document -- is the /Ŗg Veda/, a collection of more than a
thousand sacrificial hymns dedicated to a pantheon of gods and handed
down orally for many centuries before they were consigned to writing.
The next important texts are the Brāhmaņas, elaborate, often
stupefyingly detailed priestly treatises which deal with mythology only
in order to elucidate ritual. An entirely new corpus of legends is
introduced in the /Mahābhārata/, the great Epic of India, a compendium
of over 100,000 verses (ten times as long as the /Iliad/ and /Odyssey/
combined); here, interwoven with the main thread of the Epic battle
between the Pāņḍavas and their cousins the Kauravas, are numerous myths
as well as dynastic histories of obscure kings, explicit recipes for
ritual offerings, hairsplitting philosophical arguments, and tedious
discussions of caste law. The /Rāmāyaņa/, the other great Sanskrit Epic,
is far more homogeneous than the /Mahābhārata/, shorter and more
sophisticated in its literary style; the core of the poem narrates the
adventures of Rāma, but the first and last books (later accretions)
incorporate many important myths.

By far the most extensive sources of Hindu mythology, however, are the
eighteen ‘great' Purāņas and the numerous ‘minor' Purāņas, veritable
encyclopedias of Indian thought. Most Purāņas have a strong sectarian
bias, so that the same myths appear in very different versions in
different Purāņas. During the many centuries of the recension of the
Sanskrit Epics and Purāņas, a number of classical myths were retold --
and other local South Indian texts composed -- in Tamil; this large body
of literature is as yet largely untranslated and untapped, a deficit
which the present work is unfortunately not prepared to
remedy.<<frontm1.html_iinsp1>>^{[[#back1_split_002.html#insp1][1]]} The
Purāņas remain the basis of most ‘modern' Hindu retellings of the myths,
which seldom deviate far in any essential point from the spirit -- or,
indeed, <<frontm1.html_page_16>>from the letter -- of the traditional
texts. More significant divergences may be found in the mythologies of
the isolated, primitive tribes of India, which often utilize Hindu
motifs but transform them into different, sometimes almost
unrecognizable tales when absorbing them into their non-Hindu
ideological
frameworks.<<frontm1.html_iinsp2>>^{[[#back1_split_002.html#insp2][2]]}

*DATES*

The myths translated in this collection range in date from before the
twelfth century B.C. (the /Ŗg Veda/) to after the sixteenth century A.D.
(the late Purāņas). In tracing the historical developments of the myths,
it would be most useful to be able to compare the earlier and later
versions of the stories; it is, however, impossible to arrive at any
accurate estimate of their dates. The primary obstacle is inherent in
the subject matter: the myths do not /have/ dates; since the Epics and
Purāņas represent an oral tradition that was constantly revised over a
period of several thousand years, a passage actually composed in the
twelfth century A.D. may represent a surprisingly accurate preservation
of a myth handed down since the twelfth century B.C. -- or a completely
original retelling of that myth. The second obstacle is a technical one:
we cannot be certain of the dates of the various texts in which the
myths occur. The ancient Indians did not care to include in their sacred
works sufficient worldly references to historical events to allow us to
date them; even in those rare instances where datable material is
present, its value is greatly undercut by the realization that, since
many of the works were subject to frequent interpolations over a period
of many centuries, two adjacent passages may have been composed hundreds
of years apart, and any ‘date' we may have established applies only to
the short passage where the factual data occur. The absence of critical
editions of most of the Purāņas greatly compounds this problem, but even
the best critical editions cannot build <<frontm1.html_page_17>>a firm
chronological structure upon the shifting sands of oral tradition.

The dating of the Purāņas is thus an art -- it can hardly be called a
science -- unto itself. Yet in spite of the seemingly insurmountable
obstacles, many Indologists have undertaken this Heraclean -- one might
even say Augean -- task. In addition to many articles in scholarly
journals, the most useful sources for the study of the dates of the
Epics and Purāņas are the works of Farquhar, Gonda, Hazra, Kirfel,
Pargiter, Pusalker, and
Winternitz.<<frontm1.html_iinsp3>>^{[[#back1_split_002.html#insp3][3]]}
Their estimates vary widely, often to the extent of more than a thousand
years, but in general they agree upon several broad areas of Indian
mythology: /Ŗg Veda/ (/c/. 1200 B.C.); /Atharva Veda/ and Brāhmaņas
(/c./ 900 B.C.); Upaniṣads (/c./ 700 B.C.); /Mahābhārata/ (300 B.C. to
A.D. 300); /Rāmāyaņa/ (200 B.C. to A.D. 200); early Purāņas (/Brahmāņda,
Harivaṃśa, Mārkaņḍeya, Matsya, Vāyu, Viṣņu/: A.D. 300--500); middle
Purāņas (/Agni, Bhāgavata, Devī, Garuda, Kūrma, Liṅga, Saura, Vāmana,
Varāha/: A.D. 500--1000); and late Purāņas (all others, A.D.
1000--1500).

One hesitates to spill yet more ink in this chimerical pursuit, but a
broad outline of the most likely /approximate/ dates of recension of the
relevant sources may be of use to the general reader:

/Ŗg Veda/: 1200 B.C.; Sāyaņa's commentary, A.D. 1350.\\
/Atharva Veda/: 900 B.C.\\
Brāhmaņas: 900--700 B.C.\\
Upaniṣads: 700 B.C.\\
/Nirukta/ of Yāska: 500 B.C.\\
/Bṛhaddevatā/ of Śaunaka: 450 B.C.\\
/Mahābhārata/: 300 B.C.--A.D. 300.\\
/Rāmāyaņa/: 200 B.C.--A.D. 200.

Purāņas (in alphabetical order. All dates are A.D.): /Agni/: 850;
/Bhāgavata/: 950; /Bhaviṣya/: 500--1200; /Brahma/, 900--1350;
/Brahmāņḍa/: 350--950; /Brahmavaivarta/: 750--1550; /Bṛhaddharma/:
<<frontm1.html_page_18>>1250; /Bṛhannaradīya/: 750--900; /Devī/:
550--650; /Devībhāgavata/: 850--1350; /Garuḍa/: 900; /Harivaṃśa/: 450;
/Kālikā/: 1350; /Kalki/: 1500--1700; /Kūrma/: 550--850; /Liṅga/:
600--1000; /Mahābhāgavata/: 1100; /Mārkaņḍeya/: 250 (but the
/Devīmāhātmya/ section, from which myth 66 is taken, is a later
interpolation, /c/. 550); /Matsya/: 250--500; /Narasiṃha/: 400--500;
/Padma/: 750 (except for the /Sṛṣṭi Khaņḍa/, which is earlier, /c/.
600); /Sāmba/: 500--800; /Saura/: 950--1150; /Śiva/: 750--1350 (with
great variation between individual /Khaņḍas/); /Skanda/: 700--1150
(also with great variations); /Vāmana/: 450--900; /Varāha/: 750; /Vāyu/:
350; /Viṣņu/: 450.

*SELECTION*

Any selection of texts from such a rich treasury of mythology is
necessarily arbitrary, and I must confess to having chosen many myths
simply because I like them. But I have tried to strike a balance between
variety and pattern -- to select myths of as many different types as
possible while remaining within the mainstream of Hindu tradition, so
that all the myths, however various, fit somewhere within the general
pattern which underlies that tradition. I have included some myths from
each major period of religious development: some fairly long
([[#chapter2.html#myt19][19]], [[#chapter2.html#myt25][25]],
[[#chapter3.html#myt33][33]], [[#chapter4.html#myt37][37]],
[[#chapter7.html#myt72][72]], [[#chapter7.html#myt75][75]]), some
consisting of a single verse ([[#chapter2.html#myt13a][13a]],
[[#chapter2.html#myt14a][14a]], [[#chapter2.html#myt21][21]],
[[#chapter5.html#myt53][53]]) or a short passage
([[#chapter1.html#jai][1]], [[#chapter2.html#myt17][17]],
[[#chapter2.html#myt20][20]], [[#chapter5.html#myt47][47]],
[[#chapter5.html#myt52][52]]); some famous and already anthologized
([[#chapter1.html#jai1][2]], [[#chapter5.html#myt58][58--61]],
[[#chapter7.html#myt72][72]]), others obscure even to scholars
([[#chapter1.html#myt11][11]], [[#chapter1.html#myt12][12]],
[[#chapter4.html#myt42][42]], [[#chapter6.html#myt69][69]]); some in
‘critical editions' ([[#chapter2.html#myt26][26]],
[[#chapter2.html#myt28][28]], [[#chapter4.html#myt35][35]],
[[#chapter5.html#myt56][56]]), others with interpolations rejected by
these editions ([[#chapter1.html#myt8][8]],
[[#chapter2.html#myt25][25]], [[#chapter3.html#myt32][32--3]],
[[#chapter4.html#myt37][37]], [[#chapter4.html#myt40][40]],
[[#chapter7.html#myt72][72]], [[#chapter7.html#myt74][74]]); some --
about two thirds -- from works available in translation, the other third
from untranslated works. (I have made my own translations of all of the
myths in this collection, but the reader may use the existing
translations, despite their occasional inaccuracies, to supply the full
context of a myth or to indicate the main points of
<<frontm1.html_page_19>>other variants.) I have also tried to choose
myths of different types: some straightforward, almost primitive in
their simplicity ([[#chapter1.html#jai][1]],
[[#chapter2.html#myt27][27]], [[#chapter5.html#myt50][50]],
[[#chapter7.html#myt73][73]]), others more elaborate and sophisticated
both in language and in concept ([[#chapter1.html#myt8][8]],
[[#chapter2.html#myt18][18]], [[#chapter4.html#myt37][37]],
[[#chapter5.html#myt56][56]], [[#chapter5.html#myt62][62]],
[[#chapter6.html#myt68][68]]); some deeply devotional
([[#chapter4.html#myt39][39]], [[#chapter5.html#myt54][54]],
[[#chapter5.html#myt59][59]], [[#chapter6.html#myt66][66]]), others
almost satirical in their attitude toward the gods
([[#chapter1.html#myt12][12]], [[#chapter2.html#myt28][28]],
[[#chapter4.html#myt40][40]], [[#chapter5.html#myt55][55]],
[[#chapter6.html#myt68][68]], [[#chapter7.html#myt75][75]]).

In order to demonstrate how myths develop in the course of time, and how
different changes can be rung upon a single theme, I have thought it
best to translate groups of myths about a few of the most important
Hindu gods, rather than to offer single myths about unrelated minor gods
(though these figures do appear in supporting roles in the course of the
collection). Implicit in this point is a rather arbitrary principle of
selection that should be admitted at the outset: these myths are about
gods, rather than about men or ideas. This is in part a practical rule
of thumb which facilitates a greater focus on a pattern that might be
obscured by the inclusion of some of the thousands of Indian legends and
fables; but, more important, I think it can be well argued as a matter
of principle that, just as ‘biography is about chaps', so mythology is
about gods. The range of texts upon which I have drawn for this
collection is, in spite of its great extent in time and sheer volume, a
coherent body of literature concerning an interrelated group of figures
who, rather like a repertory theatre group, fill all the major parts in
the cosmic drama, exchanging roles from time to time and sometimes
undergoing significant character developments, but always remaining in
character.

As the Hindu gods are ‘immortal' only in a very particular sense -- for
they are born, and they die -- they experience most of the great human
dilemmas and often seem to differ from mortals only in a few trivial
details (gods do not sweat or blink, for example) and from demons even
less. Yet they are regarded by the Hindus as a class of beings /by
definition/ totally different from any other; they are symbols in a way
that no <<frontm1.html_page_20>>human being, however ‘archetypal' his
life story, can ever be. They are actors playing parts that are real
only for us; they are the masks behind which we see our own faces. For
this reason, stories about gods -- to which I would restrict the use of
the term ‘myths' -- have an impact totally different from that of
stories about men -- which I would call ‘legends', and I have limited my
selection to the former.

This yardstick has necessarily excluded a number of famous and important
Hindu stories about men which might otherwise have been considered
myths: the story of Śunaḥśepha, who was offered as a human sacrificial
victim until the gods themselves rescued him at the last
minute;<<frontm1.html_iinsp4>>^{[[#back1_split_002.html#insp4][4]]} the
tale of Yayāti, whose infidelity to Devayānī brought upon him the curse
of premature old age from her father Śukra (see myth 74, pp.
[[#chapter7.html#page_282][282--9]]), whereupon Yayāti -- in order to
make love to a nymph sent to seduce him -- transferred his infirmity to
one of his five sons, whom he later restored to
youth;<<frontm1.html_iinsp5>>^{[[#back1_split_002.html#insp5][5]]} the
legend of Sagara, whose sacrificial horse was stolen and carried away to
the subterranean regions, after which Sagara's sixty thousand sons dug
down for it (creating the great chasm known as the ocean) and were burnt
to ashes, to be revived later by the Ganges' descent from
heaven;<<frontm1.html_iinsp6>>^{[[#back1_split_002.html#insp6][6]]} the
story of Ŗṣyaśṛṅga, who lived in the forest unaware of the existence
of women until a courtesan (whom he mistook for an ascetic like himself)
seduced him and brought him to court in order to put an end to a
drought.<<frontm1.html_iinsp7>>^{[[#back1_split_002.html#insp7][7]]}
These stories do indeed shed considerable light upon the human
condition, particularly upon the ideas of life and death encountered in
the myths, but they do not explain the causes of the great events of
life in terms of the function of divine powers as effectively as do the
myths centring upon the gods. The Hindus themselves consigned the
legends of Śunaḥśepha and the others to the parts of the Purāņas
dealing with ‘history' -- the histories of the solar and lunar dynasties
-- in contrast with the stories of the gods,
<<frontm1.html_page_21>>which they grouped under the headings of cosmic
creation and destruction.

*** TRANSLATION AND INTERPRETATION
:PROPERTIES:
:CLASS: calibre11
:END:
In translating the myths, I have remained as literal as possible,
allowing the texts to speak for themselves in their own idiom. I have
added nothing but a few names or pronouns to clarify oblique references
and occasional glosses on obscure epithets, and I have omitted nothing
but long hymns of praise. Footnotes provide only the information
necessary for an understanding of the myth; other terms and names, as
well as glosses on repetitions of terms first explained in footnotes,
will be found in the glossary ([[#back1_split_003.html#appd][Appendix
D]]). Introductory material has been kept to a minimum, merely supplying
the essential factual background, establishing the context of each myth,
and pointing out links with other myths; in this way, it is hoped that
the reader will discover his own patterns and meanings directly from the
texts.

There is no single ‘basic' version of a Hindu myth; each is told and
retold with a number of minor and major variations over the years. I
have translated several variants of some myths where significant changes
have taken place in the course of historical development (myths 10--11,
24--6, 29--33, 47--9, 52--5); in other instances I have chosen a typical
variant (or, occasionally, an atypical variant, such as myths 11, 35,
36, 41, 55, 67, and 75). For those readers who wish to read other
versions of the myths or to acquaint themselves with some of the
interpretations offered by other scholars, a further bibliography is
provided for each myth ([[#back1_split_002.html#appc][Appendix C]]) as
well as a general bibliography of Indian mythology
([[#back1_split_001.html#appb][Appendix B]]).

Whether the reader chooses to accept the scattered hints of my own
approach to the myths, or to consult the opinions of other scholars, or
to seek in the myths the answers to his own questions, he would be well
advised to remember that a myth, <<frontm1.html_page_22>>by its very
nature, has no one single meaning. The elemental simplicity of its plot,
the transparent innocence of its world-view, allows a good myth to
function like a perfect prism through which are refracted simultaneously
all the possible ways of regarding the problems encountered in the myth.
The first level that we encounter is the narrative, usually quite a good
story, though often with a rather predictable ending. Closely related is
the divine level, which concerns mythology as it used to be understood
by scholars of the classics: the metaphorical struggles of divine powers
and personalities. Above this is the cosmic level of the myth, the
expression of universal laws and processes, of metaphysical principles
and symbolic truths. And below it, shading off into folklore, is the
human level, the search for meaning in human life. Great myths are
richly ambiguous and elusive; their truths cannot be filed away into the
scholar's neat
categories.<<frontm1.html_iinsp8>>^{[[#back1_split_002.html#insp8][8]]}
Moreover, myths are living organisms that change constantly; the tale of
Indra and Vṛtra in the /Ŗg Veda/ (myth 24, pp.
[[#chapter2.html#page_74][74--6]]) does not have the same ‘meaning' as
the tale of Indra and Vṛtra in the /Mahābhārata/ (myth 26, pp.
[[#chapter2.html#page_86][86--90]]); nor do either of these myths mean
to me today what they meant when I first read them some fifteen years
ago.

In harnessing these myths, exotic and inspired creatures that they are,
to the leaden yoke of the critical apparatus, having already lamed them
with my own prosaic translation, I hope that I have not belaboured all
the life out of
them.<<frontm1.html_iinsp9>>^{[[#back1_split_002.html#insp9][9]]}
Indeed, I take heart from the words of Claude Lévi-Strauss, who has said
that while poetry may be lost in translation, ‘the mythical value of
myths remains preserved through the worst
translation'.<<frontm1.html_iinsp10>>^{[[#back1_split_002.html#insp10][10]]}

It was my father who first suggested that I write this book; but it was
not until my friend A. J. Sherman independently hit upon the idea, and
cheered me on in the enterprise, that I decided to undertake it. Since
then, Richard Gombrich, Raymond Allchin, Betty Radice, Susan Gorodetsky,
David Shulman, and Audrey Hayley have made a number of extremely useful
suggestions, and my husband has tirelessly feigned interest in the
hundreds of oral variations on each theme to which I have subjected him.

*** Creation in the /Ŗg Veda/
:PROPERTIES:
:CLASS: calibre11
:END:
To begin at the beginning of both the story and the telling of the
story, one must begin with the mythology of creation as it appears in
the /Ŗg Veda/. The creation hymns -- and indeed most of the Ŗg Vedic
hymns which allude directly to myths -- appear in the two latest books
(the first and the tenth), which already show the seeds of the
philosophical speculation that was to emerge fully in the Brāhmaņas and
Upaniṣads within a few centuries. The most basic form of Vedic
cosmogony is implicit in many early hymns, though never explicitly
described: it is the formation of distinct elements out of the primeval
cosmic flux, the evolution of order out of chaos, the propping apart of
heaven and earth. This concept of creation as separation remains at the
heart of much of later Hindu mythology (as well as Hindu social thought)
and forms the animating spark of the conflict between gods and non-gods
(demons or human beings).

INCEST: THE FATHER COMMITS INCEST WITH HIS DAUGHTER

One concept of creation which begins in the /Ŗg Veda/ and persists
through later Hindu mythology is the idea of primeval incest. No single
hymn tells this story, but scattered references may be collected to give
a summary of the Vedic myth, which never actually names the father or
the daughter and may simply express in anthropomorphic terms the idea of
the One who creates a Second with whom he unites as a
pair.^{<<chapter1.html_ipg25_fn1>>[[#page_25.html#pg25_fn1][1]]} Heaven
and earth, once so carefully <<chapter1.html_page_26>>and safely propped

As his phallus was stretched out in eagerness for the act of a man, the
manly one pulled back. He drew back again from the maiden, his daughter,
that tireless phallus which had been thrust in. As they were in the
midst of the very act of union, when the father was satisfying his
desire for the young girl, the two of them left a little of the
out-flowing seed shed upon the back of the earth in the womb of good
deeds. When the father shed his seed in his own daughter, he spilt his
seed on the earth as he united with her. The benevolent gods created
sacred speech and fashioned Rudra Vāstoṣpati, the protector of sacred
rites... As
Agni^{<<chapter1.html_ipg26_fn2>>[[#page_26.html#pg26_fn2][2]]} made the
seed for the great father, heaven, he entered into the womb, having
noticed that she was inclined to him. The hunter shot an arrow at him
boldly. The god satisfied his lust in his own daughter... As the heat of
passion came to the king for his enjoyment, heaven laid aside on the
ground the bright seed that had been spilt. Agni caused to be born the
blameless benevolent group of
youths^{<<chapter1.html_ipg26_fn3>>[[#page_26.html#pg26_fn3][3]]} and

*DISMEMBERMENT: THE PRIMEVAL MAN IS SACRIFICED*

One cosmogonic myth is the subject of an entire Ŗg Vedic hymn, which
explains original creation as the result of a primeval sacrifice -- not
a true blood sacrifice, but a dismemberment and distribution; not an
actual creation of something out of nothing, but rather a rearrangement,
another instance of order out of chaos. The primeval Man is not
/changed/ into the various forms of life; rather, he /is/ those forms,
always. It is worthy of note that creation produces not only the
physical elements of the universe but also the social order, the basis
of life in the Hindu view, as well as the seasons and the parts of the
very sacrifice from which creation proceeds.

The Man [Puruṣa] has a thousand heads, a thousand eyes, a thousand
feet. He pervades the earth everywhere and extends beyond for ten
fingers' breadth. The Man himself is all this, whatever has been and
whatever is to be. He is the lord of immortality and also lord of that
which grows on food. Such is his greatness, and the Man is yet greater
than this. All creatures make up a quarter of him; three quarters are
the immortal in heaven. With three quarters the Man has risen above, and
one quarter of him still remains here, whence he spread out everywhere,
pervading that which eats and that which does not eat. From him
Virāj^{<<chapter1.html_ipg27_fn5>>[[#page_27.html#pg27_fn5][5]]} was
born, and from Virāj came the Man, who, having been born, ranged beyond
the earth before and behind. When the gods spread the sacrifice, using
the Man as the offering, spring was the clarified butter, summer the
fuel, autumn the oblation. They anointed the Man, the sacrifice, born at
the beginning, upon the sacred grass. With him the gods, Sādhyas, and
sages sacrificed. From that sacrifice in which everything was offered,
the clarified butter was obtained, and they made it into those beasts
who live in the air, in the forest, and in villages. From that sacrifice
<<chapter1.html_page_28>>in which everything was offered, the verses and
the chants were born, the metres were born, and the
formulas^{<<chapter1.html_ipg28_fn6>>[[#page_28.html#pg28_fn6][6]]} were
born. From it horses were born, and those other animals which have a
double set of incisors; cows were born from it, and goats and sheep were
born from it.

When they divided the Man, into how many parts did they disperse him?
What became of his mouth, what of his arms, what were his two thighs and
his two feet called? His mouth was the brahmin, his arms were made into
the nobles, his two thighs were the populace, and from his feet the
servants^{<<chapter1.html_ipg28_fn7>>[[#page_28.html#pg28_fn7][7]]} were
born. The moon was born from his mind; the sun was born from his eye.
From his mouth came
Indra^{<<chapter1.html_ipg28_fn8>>[[#page_28.html#pg28_fn8][8]]} and
Agni, and from his vital breath the wind [Vāyu] was born. From his navel
the atmosphere was born; from his head the heaven appeared. From his two
feet came the earth, and the regions of the sky from his ear. Thus they
fashioned the worlds. There were seven enclosing fire-sticks for him,
and thrice seven fire-sticks when the gods, spreading the sacrifice,
bound down the Man as the sacrificial beast. With this sacrifice the
gods sacrificed; these were the first
/dharmas/.^{<<chapter1.html_ipg28_fn9>>[[#page_28.html#pg28_fn9][9]]}
And these powers reached the dome of heaven where dwell the ancient
Sādhyas and gods.

*** Creation in the Brāhmaņas and Upanisads
:PROPERTIES:
:CLASS: calibre11
:END:
The Brāhmaņas deal at great length with the question of cosmogony,
utilizing the various strands of Ŗg Vedic belief. The incestuous father
<<chapter1.html_page_29>>is now identified as Prajāpati, the lord of
creatures, and his seed is cast into the fire in place of the usual
liquid oblation -- clarified butter or Soma juice -- in a form of Vedic
sacrifice more sophisticated than the dismemberment of a victim, an
actual ritual symbolically re-enacting primeval creation.

*INCEST AND OBLATION*

*/Prajāpati commits incest and Rudra is born/*

A series of Brāhmaņa texts develops the full consequences of the
incestuous act, particularly its iniquities and dangers. The astral
symbolism which appears in these texts persists in later myths, as do
the distinction between the mortal and immortal parts of man, the idea
of the distribution of the seed into various life forms (concepts
already present /in nuce/ in the hymn of the dismemberment of the cosmic
Man), and the use of false etymologies and word-play upon names.

**** <<chapter1.html_jai2>>[[#back1_split_002.html#ganesh2][3.]] FROM THE /Aitareya Brāhmaņa/
:PROPERTIES:

:END:
Prajāpati approached his daughter; some say she was the sky, others that
she was the dawn. He became a stag and approached her, as she had taken
the form of a doe. The gods saw him and they said, ‘Prajāpati is now
doing what is not done.' They wished for one who would punish him, but
they did not find him in one another. Then they assembled in one place
the most fearful forms, and these, assembled, became the deity
Rudra;^{<<chapter1.html_ipg29_fn10>>[[#page_29.html#pg29_fn10][10]]}
therefore his name contains the sound /Bhūta/ [Bhūtapati, lord of
ghosts]. The gods said to him, ‘Prajāpati is now doing what is not done.
Pierce him.' ‘So be it', he replied, ‘and let me choose a boon from
you.' ‘Choose.' He chose as his boon the overlordship of cattle;
therefore his name contains the word cattle [Paśupati, lord of cattle].
And one who knows this name of his becomes rich in cattle. He took aim
and pierced him; when he was pierced he flew upwards; they call him ‘the
Deer'. The piercer of the deer <<chapter1.html_page_30>>is called by
that name, and the female deer is Rohiņī. The arrow, made in three
parts, became ‘the Tripartite
Arrow'.^{<<chapter1.html_ipg30_fn11>>[[#page_30.html#pg30_fn11][11]]}

When the seed of Prajāpati had been spilt, it ran and became a lake. The
gods said, ‘Let not this seed of Prajāpati spoil.' Since they said, ‘Let
not this seed of Prajāpati spoil [/mā duṣaṃ/]', it became ‘not to be
spoilt' and its name was ‘not to be spoilt'; that which is ‘not to be
spoilt' is connected with man; therefore they call that which is ‘not to
be spoilt' ‘connected with man' [/mānuṣa/, ‘mortal' or ‘descended from
Manu'],^{<<chapter1.html_ipg30_fn12>>[[#page_30.html#pg30_fn12][12]]}
with a mystery [a riddle], for the gods seem to love mystery.

They surrounded it with Agni; the Maruts blew upon it, but Agni did not
cause it to flow. They surrounded it with Agni Vaiśvānara; the Maruts
blew upon it and Agni Vaiśvānara caused it to flow. The first part of
the seed that was ignited became Ādity; the second became Bhṛgu, whom
Varuņa took, and so Bhṛgu was adopted by Varuņa. The third part, which
was brilliant [/adīdet/], became the Ādityas. The coals [/aņgārā/]
became the Aṅgirases; and when the coals blazed forth again after they
had been quenched, Bṛhaspati was born. The completely charred coals
became the black cattle; the reddened earth became tawny cattle. The ash
spread in various forms -- the buffalo, the ox, the antelope, the camel,
the ass, and the tawny cattle.

The god said to them, ‘This is mine; what remains here is mine.' But
they deprived him of his claim by reciting the verse addressed to Rudra:

<<chapter1.html_page_31>>‘Father of the Maruts, let your good will
approach us.\\
Do not separate us from the sight of the sun.\\
Spare our swift horses, O hero.\\
Let us increase in offspring, O
Rudra.'^{<<chapter1.html_ipg31_fn13>>[[#page_31.html#pg31_fn13][13]]}

*/Prajāpati and his sons create, and Rudra is born/*

The /Kauṣītaki Brāhmaņa/ expands several elements of the myth
(Prajāpati's sons, instead of the father, are involved in the incestuous
act; the daughter becomes actively seductive) and reverses certain
others (Rudra is here born from the seed for which he punishes Prajāpati
in the /Aitareya Brāhmaņa/). Motifs from the /Ŗg Veda/ also reappear:
the Ŗg Vedic arrow here becomes a thousand arrows, and Rudra has a
thousand eyes and feet, like the cosmic Man.

Prajāpati, wishing very much to have progeny, proctised asceticism. As
he became heated, five were born from him: Fire, Wind, Sun, Moon, and
the fifth, a female, Dawn. He said to them, ‘Practise asceticism,' and
they consecrated themselves; when they had been consecrated and were
practising asceticism, Dawn, the daughter of Prajāpati, took the form of
a celestial nymph and appeared before them. Their hearts were moved by
her and they poured out their seed. Then they went to Prajāpati, their
father, and they said, ‘We have poured out our seed. Let it not be
lost.' Prajāpati made a golden bowl, an arrow's breadth in height and in
width, and he poured the seed into it. Then the thousand-eyed god with a
thousand feet and a thousand fitted arrows arose.

He grasped his father Prajāpati, who said to him, ‘Why do you grasp me?'
He replied, ‘Give me a name, for without a name I will not eat food.' He
answered, ‘You are Bhava [“Existence”].' [He gave him seven more names.]

<<chapter1.html_page_32>>*OBLATION INTO FIRE: PRAJĀPATI CREATES AGNI AND
SACRIFICES INTO HIM*

The concepts of the eater versus the non-eater (or the eaten) and the
appesing of a dangerous, hungry creature are further developed in
another text. Prajāpati spills his seed into the fire as before, but now
the seed takes the form of milk that is milked out of him or butter that
is churned from him, the verb ‘rubbed' implying either or both of these
acts.

**** 5. FROM THE /Śatapatha Brāhmaņa/
:PROPERTIES:
:CLASS: calibre16
:END:
In the beginning, Prajāpati existed alone. He reflected, ‘How may I
produce progeny?' He exhausted himself practising asceticism, and he
generated Agni from his mouth. Since he generated him from his mouth,
Agni is therefore an eater of food. And he who knows that Agni is an
eater of food becomes an eater of food himself. As he generated him
first [/agre/] of all the gods, therefore he is called Agni, for the
name Agni is the same as the name Agri. When he was born, he went forth
in front, for they say that one who goes in front goes first. This is
his Agni-ness.

Prajāpati then reflected, ‘I have created from myself a food-eater,
Agni, but there is no food here other than me, whom he would not eat.'
Now, the earth was bald at that time; there were no plants nor any
trees. And this was in his mind. Then Agni turned toward him with an
open mouth, and the greatness went out of the terrified Prajāpati.
Speech is his own greatness; and speech went out of him. He desired an
offering made in himself. He
rubbed^{<<chapter1.html_ipg32_fn14>>[[#page_32.html#pg32_fn14][14]]} his
hands; and because he rubbed his hands, therefore this and this palm are
without hair. Then he obtained an offering of clarified butter or an
offering of milk; for both of these are made of milk. This offering did
not <<chapter1.html_page_33>>please him, for it was mixed with hair. He
poured it away into the fire saying, ‘Burn and drink this [/oṣa
dhaya/].' From it the plants were born; therefore they are called plants
[/oṣadhayas/]. A second time he rubbed his hands; then he obtained
another offering, an offering of clarified butter or an offering of
milk; for both of these are made of milk. This offering pleased him. He
was uncertain whether to offer this offering or not. His own greatness
said to him, ‘Offer it.' Prajāpati realized that his own [/sva/]
greatness had spoken [/āha/] to him. And so he said, ‘Svāhā' as he
offered it. Therefore one says
‘Svāhā'^{<<chapter1.html_ipg33_fn15>>[[#page_33.html#pg33_fn15][15]]} as
an offering is made.

Then he [the sun] rose up and grew hot, and then he [the wind] became
mighty and
blew.^{<<chapter1.html_ipg33_fn16>>[[#page_33.html#pg33_fn16][16]]} Then
Agni turned away. Prajāpati performed the offering, produced progeny,
and saved himself from Agni, who was death and who was about to devour
him. And whoever knows this and offers the Agnihotra oblation, he
produces progeny just as Prajāpati produced progeny. And in this way he
saves himself from Agni, death, when he is about to devour him. And
whenever one dies and is placed in the fire, he is reborn from the fire
just as he is born from his mother and father, for the fire consumes
only his body.

*INCEST, OBLATION, AND DISMEMBERMENT: BRAHMĀ COMMITS INCEST*

All three of the major methods of creation in the Vedas and Brāhmaņas
are combined in the Upaniṣads: incest, oblation (a fire sacrifice), and
dismemberment (the sacrifice of the androgynous Self into two pieces).
The distinction between mortal and immortal is further extended, but now
the false etymology for the human being is derived
<<chapter1.html_page_34>>not from the incestuous seed but from the
androgynous primeval Man, the Purusa, here regarded as a mortal but also
identified with Brahmā, the Creator, the god who supersedes the
Prajāpati of the earlier Brāhmaņas. Purusa's name in this text utilizes
the ‘preceding' etymology applied in the /Śatapatha Brāhmaņa/ to Agni,
who is connected here, as usual, with food.

**** 6. FROM THE /Bṛhadāraņyaka Upaniṣad/
:PROPERTIES:
:CLASS: calibre16
:END:
In the beginning, this universe was Soul [/ātman/] in the form of the
Man [Puruṣa]. He looked around and saw nothing other than himself.
Then, at first, he said, ‘I am,' and thus the word ‘I' was born.
Therefore even now when one is addressed he first says, ‘It is I,' and
then he speaks whatever other name he has. Since he, preceding [/pūrva/]
all this universe, burnt up [/uṣ/] all evils, he is the Man [Puruṣa].
He who knows this burns up anyone who would precede him.

He was afraid; therefore one who is all alone is afraid. He reflected,
‘Since there is nothing other than me, of what am I afraid?' Then his
fear vanished, for of what could he have been afraid? One becomes afraid
of a second. He did not rejoice; therefore one who is all alone does not
rejoice. He desired a second. He was of the same size and kind as a man
and woman closely embracing. He caused himself to fall [/pat/] into two
pieces, and from him a husband and a wife [/pati/ and /patnī/] were
born. Therefore Yājñavalkya has said, ‘Oneself is like a half-fragment.'
Therefore this space was filled by a woman. He united with her, and from
this mankind was born.

She reflected, ‘How can he unite with me after engendering me from
himself? For shame! I will conceal myself.' She became a cow; he became
a bull and united with her, and from this all the cattle were born. She
became a mare; he became a stallion. She became a female ass; he became
a male ass and united with her, and from this all whole-hooved animals
were born. She became a she-goat; he became a billy-goat;
<<chapter1.html_page_35>>she became a ewe; he became a ram and united
with her, and from this goats and sheep were born. Thus he created all
the pairs, even down to the ants.

He knew that he was creation, for he created all of this. Thus creation
arose. Whoever knows this is born in that creation of his. Then he
churned.^{<<chapter1.html_ipg35_fn17>>[[#page_35.html#pg35_fn17][17]]}
From, his mouth as the fire-hole [/yoni/] and from his two hands he
created fire. Therefore both mouth and hands are without hair on the
inside, for the fire-hole is without hair on the inside. When people
speak of him, saying, ‘Sacrifice to this god!' ‘Sacrifice to this god!',
speaking of one single god and then of another single god, it is his own
creation, and he himself is all the gods. Now, whatever is moist he
created from semen, and that is
Soma.^{<<chapter1.html_ipg35_fn18>>[[#page_35.html#pg35_fn18][18]]} All
this universe is food and the eater of food. For Soma is food, and Agni
is the eater of food. This was the surpassing creation of Brahmā, for he
created the gods, who were better than him, when he, being mortal,
created immortals. Therefore it was a surpassing creation. Whoever knows
this is born in that surpassing creation of his.

*** Creation in the /Mahābhārata/
:PROPERTIES:
:CLASS: calibre11
:END:
Prajāpati in the Epic is no longer the supreme, original god, the
universal Soul, but merely that member of the extensive Hindu pantheon
whose particular task or assignment it is to perform creation.
<<chapter1.html_page_36>>Frequently he is called Brahmā (as he is in the
Upaniṣads) or the Grandfather.

Although the creation myths of the Brāhmaņas carefully explain the
evolution of immortals from mortals, or the reverse, the main conflict
is not between gods and men but between gods and demons. In the
/Mahābhārata/, however, men as well as demons threaten the gods; unlike
Greek mythology, where the gods continually descend to earth and
interfere with the affairs of mankind, in Hindu mythology men frequently
acquire sufficient ascetic or moral power to rise to heaven and
challenge the gods. When this occurs, the gods must find a way to reduce

virtuous
demons.^{<<chapter1.html_ipg36_fn19>>[[#page_36.html#pg36_fn19][19]]}

*BRAHMĀ AND THE JEALOUS GODS CREATE EVIL WOMEN*

By far the most effective weapon used by the gods to corrupt virtuous
mortals is a woman -- usually a seductive celestial nymph, but sometimes
just Woman, the root of all evil in the misogynist, ascetic-oriented
view of the orthodox Hindu.

**** 7. FROM THE /Mahābhārata/

:END:
I will tell you, my
son,^{<<chapter1.html_ipg36_fn20>>[[#page_36.html#pg36_fn20][20]]} how
Brahmā created wanton women, and for what purpose. For there is nothing
more evil than women; a wanton woman is a blazing fire; she is the
illusion born of
Maya;^{<<chapter1.html_ipg36_fn21>>[[#page_36.html#pg36_fn21][21]]} she
is the sharp edge of the razor; she is poison, a serpent, and death all
in one.

These creatures were full of /dharma/; so we have heard. And since they
would become gods by themselves, the gods became
<<chapter1.html_page_37>>alarmed. The gods went to Brahmā, the
Grandfather, and informed him of what was on their minds, and they stood
silent before him, with downcast faces. The lord Grandfather, learning
what was in the hearts of the gods, created women by a magic ritual in
order to delude mankind. Now, the women of former creation had been
virtuous, but these sinful sorceresses arose out of the creation
performed by Prajāpati. For the Grandfather gave them all the desires
that can be desired, and those wanton women, lusting for sensual
pleasures, began to stir men up. Then the lord of gods, the lord,
created anger as the assistant of desire, and all creatures, falling
into the power of desire and anger, began to be attached to women.

*BRAHMĀ CREATES DEATH*

In another Epic myth, the woman whom Brahmā creates to preserve the
distinction between mortals and immortals is no mere seductress, but
Death
herself;^{<<chapter1.html_ipg37_fn22>>[[#page_37.html#pg37_fn22][22]]}
yet even here, as in the first /Mahābhārata/ myth cited, her weapons are
desire and anger. In many other Hindu myths, death is regarded as a
necessary evil, a measure required to preserve the balance of good and
evil and the hierarchy of the universe, to prevent overcrowding in
heaven or on earth, or simply to give human life scale, value, and
motivation. Immortality, in the Hindu view, usually denotes not an
eternity of life (which no material entity can possess) but the
enjoyment of the full allotted span of life; thus both gods and human
beings, each in their own way, must welcome death ‘at the proper time'.
This kind cruelty is often associated with Rudra-Śiva, who periodically
burns to ashes the whole universe, including the ‘immortals', at the
proper time; he appears in this text explicitly in his chaste aspect as
the Pillar (Sthāņu), as well as implicitly in the form of the tears
which become diseases, for Rudra's name is often derived from the verb
‘to weep
[/rud/].'^{<<chapter1.html_ipg37_fn23>>[[#page_37.html#pg37_fn23][23]]}

**** <<chapter1.html_page_38>><<chapter1.html_myt8>>8. FROM THE /Mahābhārata/
:PROPERTIES:
:CLASS: calibre16
:END:
At the time of creation, the Grandfather, full of fiery energy, created
living beings. These creatures increased in age and number to excess,
but they did not die again. Then there was no space anywhere between
creatures; there was no space to breathe, so congested was the triple
universe. He began to worry about how he could destroy them, but though
he kept thinking, he could not find a means of accomplishing this
destruction. He became angry, and from all the apertures of his body a
fire shot forth, and with that fire the Grandfather burnt all the
regions of the sky. The fire born of the lord's anger burnt heaven and
earth and the air, all the universe that moves or is still. All
creatures, moving and still, were burnt by that great blast of anger
when the Grandfather became angry.

Then Rudra the Pillar, the lord of Vedic sacrifices, the god who
destroys the power of his enemies, the god with tawny matted locks,
spoke to Brahmā about succour and refuge. When the Pillar had come there
because of his desire for the welfare of all creatures, Brahmā, the god
who grants boons, seemed to flare up as he said to Śiva, ‘What wish
shall I grant for you today? For you are worthy of a boon from me, and I
will do whatever you choose, whatever is in your heart, Śambhu.' The
Pillar said, ‘Know that I am concerned about the creation of living
beings. You have created these creatures; do not be angry with them,
Grandfather. Creatures everywhere are being burnt by the fire of your
energy, and when I see them, I am full of pity. Do not be angry with
them, O god, lord of the universe.'

‘I am not angry,' said Prajāpati, ‘nor is it my wish that living
creatures should cease to exist. But in order to lighten the earth I
have sought this destruction. This goddess Earth, oppressed by the
burden, has kept urging me to destroy them, for she is sinking into the
waters under the
burden,^{<<chapter1.html_ipg38_fn24>>[[#page_38.html#pg38_fn24][24]]}
great <<chapter1.html_page_39>>god. Though I pondered for a long time, I
was unable to think of a way of destroying these beings that kept
increasing; then anger entered me.' The Pillar said, ‘Have mercy;
forbear this final destruction. O lord of the thirty-three
gods,^{<<chapter1.html_ipg39_fn25>>[[#page_39.html#pg39_fn25][25]]} do
not be angry. Do not destroy creatures moving and still, all the ponds
and grasses, the
four-fold^{<<chapter1.html_ipg39_fn26>>[[#page_39.html#pg39_fn26][26]]}
community of creatures moving and still. The universe has been reduced
to ashes and flooded
over.^{<<chapter1.html_ipg39_fn27>>[[#page_39.html#pg39_fn27][27]]} Have
mercy, kind lord; this is the boon that I have chosen. Once destroyed,
these creatures will never return again in any way; therefore let this
fiery energy be absorbed by your own energy. Through your desire for the
welfare of all creatures, find some other means so that all of these
living beings may return, O Heater of Enemies. If creatures cease to
exist now, they will be cut off from any descendants. You have appointed
me to be the presiding deity over people here, O lord, lord of the
universe, for all of this universe, moving and still, is born of you. If
I have pleased you, great god, I beg that all creatures may be subject
to repetitions of birth and death.' When the god Brahmā heard this
speech of the Pillar, he controlled his words and his heart and drew his
own energy back within himself. Suppressing the fire, the blessed lord
who is worshipped by all people fashioned periodic activity and
quiescence.

But as the noble Brahmā suppressed the fire born of his
<<chapter1.html_page_40>>anger, from all the apertures of his body a
dark woman appeared, wearing red garments, with red eyes and red palms
and soles, adorned with divine ear-rings and ornaments. As she came
forth from the apertures she went to Brahmā's right, and the two gods,
lords of everything, looked at the maiden. Then the god, the first, the
lord of people, summoned her and said, ‘Death, kill these creatures. I
thought of you when I was angrily devising a means of destruction;
therefore, destroy all creatures, imbeciles and scholars. In your
passionate anger, destroy creatures without exception, and by my command
you will win great merit.' Then the young goddess Death began to brood
in sorrow. Wearing garlands of lotuses, she wept copious tears, which
she took in her hands as she prayed for the sake of the welfare of
mankind.

The wide-eyed, fragile woman, suppressing her extreme grief, joined her
palms^{<<chapter1.html_ipg40_fn28>>[[#page_40.html#pg40_fn28][28]]} and
bent like a vine, saying, ‘How could you, the Foremost of Speakers, have
created a woman like me, to carry out such a hideous task, terrifying
all creatures that breathe? I am afraid of violating /dharma/; appoint
for me some task in keeping with /dharma./ Look upon me with a
compassionate gaze, O lord, for I am so frightened. I cannot carry off
guiltless children and old men and those in their prime, creatures who
breathe, O lord of those who breathe. I beg you; have mercy on me. The
beloved sons, friends, brothers, mothers, and fathers of the dead will
think evil of me, O god, and I fear the dead whom they mourn. The
moisture of their pitiable tears will scorch me for eternal years; I am
terribly afraid of them, and I seek refuge with you. Those who have
committed sins go at the end to the house of
Yama;^{<<chapter1.html_ipg40_fn29>>[[#page_40.html#pg40_fn29][29]]} have
mercy on me, O god, lord, giver of boons; show your grace to me. This is
the boon that I wish from <<chapter1.html_page_41>>you, Grandfather of
all people, lord of gods; by your grace, I wish to practise asceticism.'

The Grandfather said, ‘Death, I fashioned you in order to destroy
creatures. Go and destroy all creatures, and do not delay. This must be,
inevitably, and cannot be otherwise. Sinless one with faultless limbs,
do as I have told you to do.' When Death heard this command, she did not
utter a word, but she stood there bowing humbly and gazing up at the
lord. Again and again he spoke to the angry woman, but she remained
silent as if robbed of her life force. Then the god of gods, lord of
lords, Brahmā himself deigned to be gratified. Smiling, the lord of
people looked down upon all people, and the anger of the lord who is
conquered by no enemy thus became calm. And the maiden went away from
him; so we have heard.

As Death slipped away without having promised to destroy creatures, she
hastened to Dhenuka. There the goddess practised the supreme asceticism
that is hard to practise: for fifteen thousand million years she stood
on one foot. As she was practising this most difficult asceticism there,
Brahmā, whose energy was great, again spoke to her, saying, ‘Death, obey
my command.' But she disregarded him and immediately began to practise
asceticism on one foot for another twenty thousand million years, and
then for yet another ten million million years she dwelt with the wild
animals. Then for twenty thousand years she ate nothing but air, and for
another eight thousand years she stood in complete silence in water.
Then the maiden went to the Kauśikī river and there she undertook
another act of asceticism, living upon only air and water; and then the
blessed one went to the Ganges, and then to Mount Meru, where she stood
all alone, as immovable as a piece of wood, for she wished for the
welfare of all beings. Then on a summit of Himālaya where the gods
performed their sacrifice she stood on one big toe for another thousand
<<chapter1.html_page_42>>million years, and by this effort she satisfied
the Grandfather.

Then he who is the creation and destruction of all people said to her,
‘My daughter, what is happening here? Do as I have told you.' But Death
replied to the lord, the Grand-father, ‘I will not carry off creatures.
Again I beg you to have mercy, O god.' As she begged him again,
terrified of the danger of
/adharma/,^{<<chapter1.html_ipg42_fn30>>[[#page_42.html#pg42_fn30][30]]}
the god of gods rebuked her, saying, ‘Righteous Death, you will commit
no act of /adharma/; subdue these creatures. My words, kind lady, can
never fail to come true. Eternal /dharma/ will enter you for this, and I
and the gods will act constantly for your welfare. And I will grant you
this other wish which you desire in your heart: creatures afflicted by
disease will not blame you. Among men, you will have the form of a man;
among women, you will have the form of a woman, and among eunuchs, a
eunuch.' When she heard this, she placed her palms together and said
again to the noble, unperishing lord of gods, ‘No.' Then the god said to
her, ‘Death, destroy mankind. There will be no /adharma/ in you,
righteous one, I promise. Those teardrops which I saw fall, and which
you held before you in your hands, will become terrible diseases which
will afflict mankind when the appointed time has come. When the time
comes for the end of all creatures that breathe, you, Death, will employ
desire and anger together; thus immeasurable /dharma/ will come to you,
and you will not incur /adharma/, for your action will be impartial.
Thus you will protect /dharma/ properly as commanded, and you will not
cause yourself to sink into /adharma./ Therefore welcome desire; let the
two of you join together and destroy creatures here.' Though she was
afraid of being known by the name of Death, she was so frightened of a
curse that she agreed to what he asked.

Then she began to destroy the life's breath of creatures that
<<chapter1.html_page_43>>breathe, at the time of their end, bewildering
them with desire and anger. And the teardrops fallen from Death became
diseases which injure the bodies of men... Thus Death was created by the
god, and when the appointed time has come she destroys creatures as is
proper; and the tears she shed are the diseases which destroy creatures
when the proper time has come.

*** Creation in the Purāņas
:PROPERTIES:
:CLASS: calibre11
:END:
The Purāņas reintroduce into Epic mythology some of the ritual and
philosophical undercurrents of the Brāhmaņa texts as well as new
devotional ideas associated with the great sectarian deities -- Viṣņu,
Śiva, and Devī. Cosmology and cosmogony are developed at great length in
the Purāņas: in addition to the three main levels of the triple universe
there are numerous subterranean hells below and a hierarchy of heavens
above the original triad. At the end of each aeon (/kalpa/), the
universe is destroyed by fire to remain submerged in the cosmic waters
while Brahmā sleeps, until the time when all is to be created anew. Each
/kalpa/ consists of four ages (/yugas/), named after four throws of the
dice: the first, the Krta Age, is the best (often it is called the Satya
Age, the Age of Truth); it is followed by the Tretā Age, the Dvāpara
Age, and finally the Kali Age, the present age, when virtue is at its
lowest ebb and the human life-span is shortest.

COSMIC CREATION: BRAHMĀ CREATES GOOD AND EVIL FROM HIS BODY

Brahmā creates the pairs of opposites, good and evil, light and dark,
either of his own will or under compulsion, for by this time his stature
has declined so much that he, like all the other gods, is powerless
against fate and his own /karma/ -- the cumulative force of his past
actions, good or bad, a force that predetermines the course of his
present existence. Moreover, only a world composed of the full variety
of qualities is desirable, let alone possible; the three ‘strands' or
qualities of matter (/guņas) -- sattva/ (goodness or light), /rajas/
(dust, <<chapter1.html_page_44>>passion, or activity), and /tamas/
(darkness or inertia) -- must always be balanced; indeed, they are
called ‘strands' because they are inextricably intertwined everywhere
like the strands of a rope.

**** 9. FROM THE /Viṣņu Purāņa/
:PROPERTIES:
:CLASS: calibre16
:END:
Although all creatures are destroyed at each cosmic dissolution, they
are not released from rebirth, but are reborn according to the
reputation of their former good or bad
/karma./^{<<chapter1.html_ipg44_fn31>>[[#page_44.html#pg44_fn31][31]]}
Therefore when Brahmā performs creation mentally, from him are born the
four-fold creatures, varying from gods to inanimate objects. When Brahmā
desired to create the four types of ‘waters' -- gods, demons, ancestors,
and men -- he harnessed the forces within his own self. When he was thus
concentrated, desiring to create, the quality of darkness became
manifest in Prajāpati, and first the demons were born from his thigh.
Brahmā then abandoned his own body which had the quality of darkness,
and that body which he had abandoned became night. Still desiring to
create, he took another body and found pleasure; then the gods, in whom
the quality of goodness was predominant, were born from the mouth of
Brahmā. He abandoned that body too, and it became the day, in which the
quality of goodness is paramount; therefore at night the demons are
powerful, and by day the gods. Then he took another body in which the
quality of goodness formed the essence, and as he thought of himself as
being like a father, the ancestors [pitaras, ‘fathers'] were born from
him. The lord then abandoned that body when he had created the
ancestors, and that cast-off body became the evening twilight which
stands between day and night. Then he took another body in which the
quality of passion was the essence, and from him was born the race of
men, in whom the quality of passion abounds. Prajāpati quickly abandoned
that body too, and it became the light of the early twilight, the dawn.
<<chapter1.html_page_45>>Therefore when this light arrives, men are
powerful, and the ancestors become powerful at the time of evening
twilight. The light of dawn, night, day, and evening twilight -- these
four are the bodies of the lord Brahmā which served as vessels for the
three qualities.

Then he took another body in which the quality of passion was the
essence, and from Brahmā hunger was born, and with hunger anger was
born. The lord then created in darkness beings that were emaciated with
hunger, deformed, bearded, and they ran to the lord. Those who said,
‘No! Not like that! Protect him [/rakṣyatām/]!' -- they became the
Rāksasas. And others, who said, ‘Let us eat!' -- they became the Yaksas,
because of eating /[jakṣaņāt]./ When the Creator looked upon them with
displeasure, the hairs fell from his head and grew upon his head again.
They became snakes, called serpents [/sarpa/] because they had glided
down [/sarpana/] and snakes [/ahi/] because they had departed /[hīna]./
Then the Creator of the Universe became angry, and he created creatures
who had anger as their essence; because of their tawny /[kapiśa]/
colour, these fierce ones are eaters of flesh /[piśitāśanas/ or
Piśācas], Then the Gandharvas were born from his body as he sang; they
are drinkers of speech and are therefore called
Gandharvas.^{<<chapter1.html_ipg45_fn32>>[[#page_45.html#pg45_fn32][32]]}

The lord Brahmā, having created these creatures when he was impelled by
their own capabilities and powers, then created others of his own will.
He made the birds [vayāṃsi] from his own youthful energy [/vayas/]; he
made sheep from his breast, goats from his mouth; Prajāpati created cows
from his stomach and his two sides. From his feet he made horses,
elephants, donkeys, oxen, deer, camels, mules, antelopes, and other
species. Grasses, fruits, and roots were born from the hairs of his
body...

<<chapter1.html_page_46>>Thus the lord Brahmā, the First Creator and
lord, created; and whatever /karma/ they had achieved in a former
creation, they received this /karma/ as they were created again and
again, harmful or benign, gentle or cruel, full of /dharma/ or
/adharma/, truthful or false. And when they are created again, they will
have these qualities; and this pleased him. The lord Creator himself
diversified the variety and differentiation of all the objects of the
senses, properties, and forms. By the authority of the Vedas, he
fashioned in the very beginning the name and form of creatures, gods and
others, the diversity of their functions, and the appellations of the
sages in the Vedas. In this way he made other creatures with the
properties appropriate to their purpose. Just as the various signs of
the seasons appear as the year revolves, so the various qualities of
creatures appear at the beginning of each age. And thus, at the
beginning of each aeon, again and again he performs creation of this
sort, for his power is the will to create and he is impelled by the
powers of the things to be created.

*PERSONAL CREATION: BRAHMĀ CURSES NĀRADA*

Another cycle of creation myths expresses in more anthropomorphic terms
some of the conflicts which appear symbolically in earlier myths --
mental or ascetic creation versus sexual creation, asceticism versus
married life, men versus women, parents versus children, sons versus
daughters.

*/Nārada curses the sons of Dakṣa/*

In the first of two such myths, Dakṣa, a son of Brahmā, plays the role
of the creator and is opposed by Nārada, a meddlesome sage and notorious
trouble-maker who here appears as the ascetic enemy of the house-holder.

**** 10. FROM THE /Vāyu Purāņa/
:PROPERTIES:
:CLASS: calibre16
:END:
The Self-created Brahmā instructed Daksa to create progeny, and then
Dakṣa created all creatures that move and those that
<<chapter1.html_page_47>>are still, during the era of Manu the son of
Vivasvat.^{<<chapter1.html_ipg47_fn33>>[[#page_47.html#pg47_fn33][33]]}
Daksa set out to create the four types of progeny: those born of the
sloughed skin, those born of eggs, those born of sprouts, and those born
of sweat.^{<<chapter1.html_ipg47_fn34>>[[#page_47.html#pg47_fn34][34]]}
For ten thousand years he practised fierce asceticism, and by the powers
of his yoga, such as the power to become infinitely small, he was able
to produce them. Then he dispersed himself among men, serpents,
Rākṣasas, gods, demons, and Gandharvas, all born of his compact
celestial body, and he created the Lords who were his own equals in
form, strength, and energy. Then, rejoicing and wishing to create
various kinds of progeny, he made other creatures that move and that are
still, all born from his mind, and he made the sages, gods, Gandharvas,
men, serpents, Rākṣasas, Yakṣas, ghosts, Piśācas, birds, domestic
cattle, and wild beasts.

But these progeny born of his mind did not increase, for they were
cursed by the wise lord Śiva, the great god. Then Dakṣa wished to
create various progeny by means of pairing and emotion, and he married a
wife, Asiknī, the daughter of the Prajāpati Vīrana; she had great
ascetic powers and was capable of supporting people, for indeed she
supported this whole universe, moving and still...

The sons of Dakṣa, the Haryaśvas, who had great heroic powers,
assembled, for they wished to increase progeny. But Nārada said to them,
‘How childish you are. You do not know the surface of the earth, how far
it extends, how high or low; then how will you create
progeny?^{<<chapter1.html_ipg47_fn35>>[[#page_47.html#pg47_fn35][35]]}
What is the measure of the earth? What is to be created? Without
understanding <<chapter1.html_page_48>>this, how will you create? You
would create too little or too much, and this would be a fault.' When
they heard his words they set out in all directions, following the wind,
and they disappeared; even today they have not returned, but are
wandering with the winds. Thus the great sages wander on the path of the
wind.

When his sons had been destroyed, Dakṣa the son of Pracetas begat
another thousand sons in the daughter of Vīraņa. They, the Śabalāśvas,
wishing to increase progeny, were again addressed by Nārada as he had
spoken before. Heeding his words, all those youths of great vitality
said to one another, ‘The great sage speaks the truth. We must follow
the footsteps of our brothers; there can be no doubt of this. When we
have learned the measure of the earth, we will happily create progeny.'
Then they too went forth on that path in all directions, and even today
they have not returned, like people who have been shipwrecked at sea.
From that time forth, a brother who delights in following his brother
and sets forth is destroyed; and this should not be done by a wise man.

When the Śabalāśvas had been destroyed, the lord Daksa became angry, and
he cursed Nārada, saying: ‘You will be destroyed, and you will become an
embryo.' When his noble sons had been destroyed, Dakṣa begat sixty
famous daughters in the daughter of Vīraņa. The lord Kasyapa took one of
them in marriage to be his wife, and so did
Dharma,^{<<chapter1.html_ipg48_fn36>>[[#page_48.html#pg48_fn36][36]]}
Soma, the lord Śiva, and the other great sages. Whoever truly knows this
whole creation by Dakṣa becomes long-lived, famous, wealthy, and rich
in progeny.

*/Brahmā curses Nārada/*

A more elaborate version of this myth, in which Brahmā resumes the role
of the Creator, reintroduces more abstract levels of creation -- time
<<chapter1.html_page_49>>and measurement, music and scripture -- but
suddenly reverts to human imagery with the statement that Brahmā's wife
gave these entities her breast to suck; furthermore, Nārada himself is
here regarded as one of Brahmā's sons. The creation of abstractions,
like the mental creation of living beings, is relatively simple, but
difficulties immediately arise when concrete, physiological processes
are introduced. The all-pervasive Vaisnava bias of this version presents
yet another conflict -- a sectarian opposition between the (Śaiva)
father, creator of the Rudras, and the sons, worshippers of Kṛṣņa (who
were cursed by Śiva in the shorter version of the myth). This same
sectarianism is used to account for the decline in the worship of
Brahmā.

**** <<chapter1.html_myt11>>11. FROM THE /Brahmavaivarta Purāņa/
:PROPERTIES:
:CLASS: calibre16
:END:
When Brahmā had fashioned all this universe, he placed his seed in
Sāvitrī, his best wife, as a man full of desire places his seed in a
woman full of desire. For a hundred celestial years she held the embryo,
which was difficult to bear, and then when she was ready to give birth
she bore the four enchanting Vedas, the various branches of knowledge
such as logic and grammar, the thirty-six celestial Rāgīņs that capture
the heart and the six beautiful Rāgas with their various rhythms. And
she brought forth the Satya, Tretā, and Dvāpara Ages, and the Kali Age
which is rich in quarrels, and the year, the month, the season, the
lunar day, the inch, the second, and other measurements. She brought
forth day and night, the days of the week, twilight and dawn; the
goddesses Nourishment, Army of the Gods, Memory, Conquest, and Victory,
and the six
Kṛttikās;^{<<chapter1.html_ipg49_fn37>>[[#page_49.html#pg49_fn37][37]]}
the yogas and religious acts which result in abundant asceticism. She
brought forth the great Ṣaṣthī, the Army of the Gods, who is dear to
Kārttikeya; she is the leader of the Mothers, and she is the chosen
divinity of children. The trinity of aeons -- that of Brahmā, that of
the lotus, and that of the boar; the natural, two-fold division --
<<chapter1.html_page_50>>that which is constant and that which is
momentary; the four kinds of universal dissolution, and time, and the
maiden Death, and all the groups of diseases -- all these she brought
forth, and she gave them all her breast to suck.

Then Adharma was born from the back of the Creator, and Misfortune
[/alakṣmī/] arose, insatiably lustful, from his left side. From his
navel were born Viśvakarman, the guru of all artists, and the eight
great Vasus, powerful and aggressive. And then from the mind of the
Creator four little boys appeared, five years old, blazing with the
energy of religion. They were Ancient, Joyous, Eternal, and
Eternally-young, the best of wise
men.^{<<chapter1.html_ipg50_fn38>>[[#page_50.html#pg50_fn38][38]]} From
Brahmā's mouth there appeared a boy shining like gold, a handsome youth
with a celestial form, accompanied by a wife. He was the seed of all
noble warriors, and his name was Manu the son of the Self-created; and
the woman was Śatarūpā, first in beauty, delicate as a lotus. Manu
remained with his wife to uphold the command of the Creator.

Then the Creator said to his sons, who were
exulting,^{<<chapter1.html_ipg50_fn39>>[[#page_50.html#pg50_fn39][39]]}
‘Illustrious ones, perform creation.' But they said, ‘No,' and they went
to practise asceticism, for they were devoted to Kṛṣņa. Because of
this, the Creator, lord of universes, became angry, and as he was filled
with anger, blazing with the energy of religion, the eleven Rudras
appeared from his forehead; the first among them is famed as the
Destroyer, the Rudra of the Doomsday Fire; he is known as the Dark One
throughout the universes, while Brahmā himself is the Passionate and the
auspicious Viṣņu is the One Made of Goodness. But Kṛṣņa, the lord of
the world of cows, is without qualities, beyond nature; only fools who
do not know the Supreme speak of Śiva as the Dark One, for he is in the
vanguard of all Vaiṣņavas, spotless, and pure goodness is his own form.
Now <<chapter1.html_page_51>>hear the names of the Rudras as they are
proclaimed in the Vedas: Great, Noble, Wise, Terrifying, Frightening,
He-who-has-seasons-as-his-banner, He-whose-hair-stands-up, Tawny-eyed,
Brightness, Purity (and Rudra-the-howler as the eleventh).

Then Pulastya was born from his right ear and Pulaha from his left ear;
Atri from his right nostril and Kratu from his left nostril. Araņi was
born from within his nose, the shining Aṅgiras from within his mouth,
Bhṛgu from his left side, and
Dakṣa^{<<chapter1.html_ipg51_fn40>>[[#page_51.html#pg51_fn40][40]]}
from his right side. From his shadow, the ascetic named Mud was born,
and from his navel the sage with five tufts of hair on his head. From
his breast was born the sage Voḍhu, and from his neck Nārada. Marīci
was born from his shoulder, and the sage named
Darkness-within-the-waters from his throat. Vasiṣṭha was born from his
tongue, and Pracetas from his lower lip. From the left side of his
stomach the ascetic named the Goose was born, and from the right side
was born the Ascetic
himself.^{<<chapter1.html_ipg51_fn41>>[[#page_51.html#pg51_fn41][41]]}

Then the Creator commanded his sons to continue with creation, but when
Nārada heard his father's speech he said to him, ‘Grandfather, lord of
the universe, first fetch my older brothers, Ancient and the others, and
then speak to us about taking wives. Their father allowed them to
practise asceticism; then why should we become involved in the wheel of
rebirth?... As the flickering flame bewitches insects, as a scrap of
flesh on a fish-hook causes the fish to fling himself upon it for the
pleasure he thinks it will give him -- so, father, the objects of the
senses bring death to those who are attached to sensual and material
life, for they are as transitory <<chapter1.html_page_52>>as dreams,
vain, unreal, and deadly.' When Nārada had said this, he stood before
the Creator, bowing to him, blazing like the flame of a fire.

Then Brahmā was overcome by anger, and he cursed his son; his limbs
shook, his eyes were red, and his lip trembled as he said, ‘Your
knowledge will be wiped out by my curse, Nārada; you will be enticed
like a beast kept for pleasure, a wanton lusting after women. You will
charm the hearts of beautiful women intent upon permanent youth, and you
will be the husband of fifty lustful women, dear to them as their very
life's breath. You will be a savant of the erotic textbooks, ardently
longing for the great erotic pleasures, the guru of the guru of those
who are adept in the various ways of making love. You will be the best
of the Gandharvas, singing beautifully with a beautiful voice, proud of
your skill in playing on the lute, and you will be permanently young. No
doubt you will be intelligent, sweet-speaking, calm, artful, handsome,
and crafty, and your name will be Upabarhana [‘the Pillow']. When you
have sported with these women for two hundred thousand celestial years
in a deserted forest, then by my curse you will be the son of a slave
girl. But then, my child, because of your attachment to Vaiṣņavas and
because you will have eaten what is cast off and left by Vaiṣņavas, by
the grace of Kṛṣņa you will again be my son, and then I will give you
celestial, eternal knowledge once more. But now, my son, you will be
destroyed and you will be forced to fall.'

When Brahmā, the lord of the universe, had said this to his son, Nārada
wept and, folding his palms together, he said to his father, ‘Restrain
your anger, father, my father, Guru of the Universe, Restrainer. Alas,
that the anger of the Creator, lord of ascetics, has fallen upon me
without cause. A wise man should curse and abandon a son who embarks on
the wrong path; but why should you, a learned man, curse your ascetic
<<chapter1.html_page_53>>son? Let me be born in any wombs whatever, but
do not cause me to abandon my devotion to Hari; grant me this boon,
Brahmā. If the son of the Creator of the Universe is no longer devoted
to the foot of Hari, he dies as the very lowest upon earth, surpassed
even by a pig... Four-headed Brahmā, since you cursed me when I had
committed no offence, you deserve to be cursed by me, for even learned
men will harm one who harms them. By my curse, Manu will be injured by
the sun^{<<chapter1.html_ipg53_fn42>>[[#page_53.html#pg53_fn42][42]]}
despite all his amulets and hymns in your praise and acts of worship for
you. And you will not be worshipped among all men for three aeons,
father, but when these three aeons have passed you will again be
worshipped, for you are worthy of worship. Then you will have a portion
of the sacrifice and you will be given one kind of worship in all
religious vows and similar acts, and you will be honoured by the gods
and others.' When Nārada had said this to his father, the Creator
remained in the assembly with an aching heart. Then Nārada was reborn as
Upabarhaņa, the Gandharva, son of a slave girl, because of his father's
curse, but afterwards Nārada became a great sage again and obtained
knowledge from his father.

*THE DEGRADATION OF BRAHMĀ: HE TRIES TO RAPE ANASŪYĀ AND IS CURSED*

By the time of the later Purāņas, Brahmā was no longer generally
worshipped (just as Nārada had predicted), although he was allowed to
maintain his old position as Creator in the mythology. Viṣņu and Śiva
are linked with him in the myth of Anasūyā, which exalts Brahmins even
above the great sectarian gods, but it is Brahmā who speaks for the
Trinity, and his speech is ironically reminiscent of the words that his
more illustrious antecedent, the Prajāpati of the Brāhmaņas, spoke in
the course of his primeval incest.

Self-created Prajāpati heard their speech but did not say anything in
reply, for he was firmly immersed in the highest Self. Observing his
emotion, the three eternal gods went to his wife Anasūyā and spoke to
her. Rudra himself had a

was true to her vow to her husband, heard their improper speech she did
not say anything in reply, for she feared the anger of the gods. But the
gods, out of their minds, grabbed her by force and prepared to rape her,
for they were deluded by the Goddess's magic power.

Then the sage's beloved and faithful wife became angry and cursed them,
saying, ‘You will be my sons, for you have been
<<chapter1.html_page_55>>infatuated by desire. The /liṅga/ of the great

always be worshipped by men, and so the supreme gods will be the supreme
laughing-stock.' When they heard this terrible speech, they bowed to the
sage's beloved wife, bent low with reverence, and praised her with Vedic
verses as recited by the gods. Then Anasūyā said, ‘When you are my
little sons, you will be freed from my curse and you will be content.'
Then Brahmā became Candramas, Hari became Dattātreya, and the lord Hara
became incarnate as Durvāsas. And they all became yogis in order to
dispel that evil.

*** The Vedic cycle of Indra and Vṛtra
:PROPERTIES:
:CLASS: calibre11
:END:
THE mythology of the god Indra, king of the gods, warrior of the gods,
god of rain, begins in the /Ŗg Veda./ Unfortunately for the student of
mythology, none of the Ŗg Vedic hymns actually sets out to narrate a
myth; rather, various myths are alluded to, often in enigmatic terms. To
‘read' a Vedic myth about Indra, therefore, it is necessary to have
recourse to later Indian commentaries, interpretations, and reworkings
of the Vedic myths, and then to re-examine the Vedic hymns themselves in
the light of this knowledge.

*INDRA BEHEADS DADHYAÑC, WHO REVEALS TVAṢṢŖ'S MEAD TO THE AŚVINS*

The obscure verse which alludes to this myth is somewhat clarified by
the knowledge that ‘honey' refers to the Soma juice, an intoxicant that
was drunk by the priests and offered to the gods in the sacrifice, often
mixed with milk; that the Vedic horse-sacrifice consisted in the
beheading of a stallion; that the Aśvins had the heads of horses; that
to ‘know' the secret of the Soma was to have the power of the magic
formula, the word; and that Tvaṣṭṛ, the father of Indra, is later
killed by Indra.

O Aśvins, you placed a horse-head upon Dadhyañc, the son of the Atharvan

<<chapter2.html_page_57>>The actual events of the story, and Indra's
connection with it, only emerge after the reading of a Brāhmaņa
expansion of this text.

Now, Dadhyañc, the son of the Atharvan priest, knew this essence, this
sacrifice -- how this head of the sacrifice is put on again, how this
sacrifice becomes complete. Indra said to him, ‘If you teach this to
anyone else, I will cut off your head.' Now, the Aśvins heard this:
‘Dadhyañc, the son of the Atharvan priest, knows this essence, this
sacrifice -- how the head of the sacrifice is put on again, how the
sacrifice becomes complete.' They went to him and said, ‘Let us be your
pupils.' He asked, ‘What would you wish to learn?' ‘This essence, this
sacrifice -- how the head of the sacrifice is put on again, how the
sacrifice becomes complete,' they replied. He said, ‘Indra said to me,
“If you teach this to anyone else, I will cut off your head.” Therefore,
I fear that he might indeed cut off my head. I will not accept you as
pupils.' They said, ‘We two will protect you from him.' ‘How will you
protect me?' ‘When you accept us as pupils, we will cut off your head
and put it somewhere else; then we will bring a horse's head and place
it upon you. With that you will teach us, and when you have taught us,
then Indra will cut off that head of yours. Then we will bring your own
head and place it upon you again.' He agreed and accepted them as
pupils, and when he had received them as pupils they cut off his head
and placed it somewhere else, and they brought the head of a horse and
placed it on him. With that head he taught them, and when he had taught
them, Indra cut off that head of his. Then they brought his own head and
placed it on him again.

The story of Dadhyañc does not end there. Another cryptic Ŗg Vedic hymn

by Indra.

in the mountains, he found it in Śaryaņāvat. Then they knew the secret
name of the cow of Tvaṣṭṛ, in the house of the moon.

Sāyaņa, a great Vedic commentator of the fourteenth century A.D.,
explains the myth to which this hymn refers.

:PROPERTIES:
:CLASS: calibre16
:END:
The demons obtained supremacy merely by looking at Dadhyañc, the son of
the Atharvan priest, while he was alive. And when he went to heaven, the
earth was filled with demons. Indra, who could not fight with the
demons, searched for that sage, and he was told that he had gone to
heaven. Then Indra asked the people there, ‘Is there no limb left of him
here?' and they replied, ‘There is the horse-head by which he told the
Aśvins the secret of the honey. But we do not know where that head might
be.' Then Indra said, ‘Search for it,' and they searched for it. They
discovered it in Śaryaņāvat and brought it. Śaryaņāvat is the name of a
lake that flows in the western half of the Plain of Kuru. With the bones
of that head, Indra slew the demons.

The link between this and the first Dadhyañc episode is provided by
Śaunaka, a commentator of the fifth century B.C. He identifies
Śaryaņāvat not as a lake but as a mountain; yet he also mentions a lake,
for the myth must provide a watery home for the fiery horse-head that
emerges to destroy the universe at the end of the
aeon.^{<<chapter2.html_ipg58_fn2>>[[#page_58.html#pg58_fn2][2]]}

:PROPERTIES:
:CLASS: calibre16
:END:
Because Dadhyañc had told the secret of the mead to the two
<<chapter2.html_page_59>>Aśvins by means of the horse-head, Indra took
away that head, and the two Aśvins then replaced Dadhyañc's own head
upon him. The horse-head, cut off by the thunderbolt of Indra who bears
the thunderbolt, fell into the middle of a lake on Mount Śaryaņāvat.
Rising up from those waters to grant various wishes to living beings, it
lies submerged in the waters until the end of the aeon.

The search for the magic of resuscitation, and the destruction of a sage
who revives demons, are themes which persist in later Hindu
mythology.^{<<chapter2.html_ipg59_fn3>>[[#page_59.html#pg59_fn3][3]]}
The role of Tvaṣṭṛ (also called Viśvakarman, ‘All-fashioner') in this
particular episode, as well as in the first Dadhyañc hymn, is further
explained by Sāyaņa, who draws upon other bits of Vedic lore: Tvaṣṭṛ
-- the Architect, artisan of the gods -- had a magic cow whose udder
yielded Soma; he hid this cow from Indra, and only Dadhyañc knew this
secret; Dadhyañc told this to the Aśvins, and Indra beheaded Dadhyañc
and stole Tvaṣṭṛ's Soma. Sāyaņa's exegesis also resolves the tension
between the solar and lunar symbolism; Indra and Tvaṣṭṛ are sun gods,
but Soma is said to be stored in the moon.

The cow of Tvaṣṭṛ -- who is the blazing sun -- is a traveller in the
house -- that is, the orb -- of the moon. Her own name -- that is, the
energy of the sun -- is hidden -- disappearing at night. But they
recognize her by her rays, for the sun's rays are reflected in the clear
circle of the moon, which is made of water, and these rays reflected
there create an identical sign or image even when cast upon the moon --
this is the meaning. When the solar energy that disappears at night
enters the circle of the moon, then, dispelling the darkness of night,
it illuminates everything as if it were day. The sun which has this kind
of energy is Indra himself, for Indra is enumerated
<<chapter2.html_page_60>>among the twelve
suns.^{<<chapter2.html_ipg60_fn4>>[[#page_60.html#pg60_fn4][4]]} Indra

*TVAṢṢŖ GIVES HIS DAUGHTER SARAŅYŪ TO VIVASVAT*

Just as the two episodes related above combine to tell the tale of
Dadhyañc, so the Dadhyañc tale itself is merely an episode in yet
another myth of Tvaṣṭṛ; and the story of Tvaṣṭṛ is, in turn,
merely one episode in the myth of Indra, a myth which is never told in
full in any one text but which was known in its entirety to many
educated Indians.

*/The Aśvins, Yama and Yamī, and Manu are born/*

The myth of Tvaṣṭṛ and his daughter was told, directly though
briefly, by the etymologist Yāska at the turn of the fifth century B.C.

**** <<chapter2.html_myt15>>15. FROM THE /Nirukta/

Saraņyū, the daughter of Tvaṣṭṛ, bore a pair of twins to Vivasvat,
the sun. Then she substituted for herself another, identical female, and
she herself took the form of a mare and fled. Vivasvat, the sun, took
the form of a horse in the same way and followed her. Thus the Aśvins
were born, and Manu was born in the identical female.

*/Tvaṣṭṛ begets Triśiras and Saraņyū/*

The ‘identical female' in Yāska's cryptic tale is reminiscent of the
‘image' of the sun placed in the moon, while the procreative sun god who
becomes a stallion to cover the unwilling, chaste mare resembles the
incestuous creator in another equine Vedic
cycle.^{<<chapter2.html_ipg60_fn5>>[[#page_60.html#pg60_fn5][5]]} The
details of the episode are made somewhat clearer in the version told by
Śaunaka in a work composed only shortly after that of Yāska.

Tvaṣṭṛ had twin children, Saraņyū and Triśiras
[‘Three-<<chapter2.html_page_61>>headed']. He himself gave Saraņyū in
marriage to Vivasvat. Then Yama and Yamī were born of Saraņyū and
Vivasvat; these two also were twins, but Yama was the elder of the two.
Without her husband's knowledge, Saraņyū created a woman identical to
herself; entrusting the twins to the latter, she became a mare and went
away. But in ignorance of this, Vivasvat begat upon the woman a son,
Manu, who became a royal sage with energy like that of Vivasvat. Then he
became aware that Saraņyū had departed in the form of a mare, and he
went quickly after the daughter of Tvaṣṭṛ, having become a horse of
the same qualities. And Saraņyū, knowing that it was Vivasvat in the
form of a horse, approached him for sexual intercourse, and he mounted
her. But in their haste the semen fell on the ground, and the mare
smelled that semen because she desired to become pregnant. From that
semen that was inhaled two youths were born, called Nāsatya
[‘From-the-nose'] and Dasra [‘Performing-wondrous-deeds'], famed as the
Aśvins.

*/Tvaṣṭṛ gives his daughter to Vivasvat/*

Of the four sets of twins in the /Bṛhaddevatā/ (the two Aśvins, the
‘twin' wives, the twin children of Tvaṣṭṛ and the twins Yama and
Yamī), only two are mentioned in the original Ŗg Vedic verse upon which
the myth is based.

‘Tvaṣṭṛ is giving a wedding for his daughter' -- hearing this, the

Vivasvat, disappeared.
They^{<<chapter2.html_ipg61_fn6>>[[#page_61.html#pg61_fn6][6]]}
concealed the immortal woman from mortals. Making an identical woman,
they gave her to Vivasvat. Saraņyū bore the two Aśvins, and then she
abandoned the two twins.

<<chapter2.html_page_62>>*YAMA REJECTS YAMĪ AND BECOMES KING OF THE
DEAD*

Yama, the first son of the sun, becomes the first mortal man and later
god of the dead, while Manu, the sun's son in post-Vedic versions, is
said to be the ancestor of the human race but is not deified. The myth
of Yama and Yamī is connected with the Indra corpus in several ways,
although Indra himself does not appear in the Ŗg Vedic hymn on which the
myth is based: the Yama myth is not only a part of the Saraņyū myth but
a multiform of it; Tvaṣṭṛ is active in both myths as the architect
/par excellence/; Vivasvat is the father of Yama and husband of Saraņyū;
Yama, like Indra, is one of the four guardians of the quarters
(Lokapālas) in later Hindu mythology; and the messengers of Yama are two
brindle dogs, the descendants of Saramā the bitch of Indra. Both the
Yama myth and the Saraņyū myth may be seen as examples of the theme of
the union of a mortal man with an immortal woman, resulting in the birth
of Agni. (The myth of primeval incest also relates the union of a
heavenly father and chthonic daughter to produce a son in the fire
sacrifice, and in later mythology the celestial god Rudra unites with
Pārvatī, the chthonic daughter of the mountain, to produce a son who is
the child of
fire.^{<<chapter2.html_ipg62_fn7>>[[#page_62.html#pg62_fn7][7]]}) In
spite of many obscurities and confusions -- contradictory statements
about the identity of the mothers and of the children -- it is clear
that the idea of twinness and the correlated idea of the conjunction and
interactions of opposites (male and female, night and day, earth and
heaven, mortal and immortal, ascetic purity and desire for progeny)
underlie both sets of myths.

good is a sister, when destruction comes down upon her? Overcome with
desire, I beg you again and again: unite your body with my body.'

[Yama:] ‘Never will I agree to unite my body with your body. They call a
man who unites with his sister an evil man. Seek your pleasures with
some other man than me. Your brother does not wish this, fair one.'

<<chapter2.html_page_65>>[Yamī:] ‘Fie, fie, Yama, you are feeble; I see
no creative power of thought nor any heart in you. Indeed, let some
other woman embrace you like a girth embracing a stallion or a creeper
embracing a tree.'

[Yama:] ‘Yamī, you will indeed embrace another man, and he will embrace
you, as a creeper embraces a tree. Desire his creative power of thought,
and let him desire yours. Join with him in an auspicious union.'

*/Yama becomes king of the dead/*

The story of the union of Yama and Yamī, which is more fully developed
in Iranian mythology, is almost never referred to again in Hindu
mythology. But the role of Yama (and his sister Yamī, who becomes the
river Yamunā) in the story of Saraņyū is often told, usually in
connection with his appointment as god of the dead. In these later
versions, the ‘identical woman' who replaces Saraņyū is sometimes called
Saṃjñā, ‘the Image', probably for the reason suggested by Sāyaņa:
Tvaṣṭṛ's daughter, the energy of the sun, becomes a bright image
reflected in the
moon.^{<<chapter2.html_ipg65_fn15>>[[#page_65.html#pg65_fn15][15]]}
Sāyaņa identifies her with the cow of the original Ŗg Vedic verse; in
the later tradition she becomes a mare, probably because she is the
mother of the equine Aśvins. But in most Purāņic texts, the figure of
Saraņyū herself -- the original wife of Vivasvat -- is given the name of
Saṃjñā, and it is this woman, the bright image, who then seeks a
replacement -- the dark shadow.

In one Purāņic text, the twins of opposition are further proliferated:
now there are two Manus, both claiming the sun as their father but only
one born of the ‘true' wife of the sun. Other conflicts arise within the
family, all but one a conflict between male and female and all but one a
conflict between parents and children: husband versus wife (Vivasvat and
Saṃjñā), daughter versus father (Saṃjñā and Tvaṣṭṛ), son versus
step-mother (Yama and the ‘shadow' Saṃjñā), and husband versus
father-in-law (Vivasvat and Tvaṣṭṛ). On the symbolic level, the
opposition between light and dark forms the basis of a myth of the death
and revival of the sun and a myth of the birth of death. The sin of
partiality in the anthropomorphic mother is
<<chapter2.html_page_66>>contrasted with the impartiality of the son,
the god of the
dead,^{<<chapter2.html_ipg66_fn16>>[[#page_66.html#pg66_fn16][16]]}
whose own mortality is emphasized by the image of carnal decay -- worms
bearing his flesh to the earth. The concept of the control and
distribution of excess, so basic to Hindu cosmogony, is expressed in the
episode of the trimming of the sun as well as in the image of the
fiery-mouthed mare, the mother of the Aśvins, who later becomes the
doomsday
mare,^{<<chapter2.html_ipg66_fn17>>[[#page_66.html#pg66_fn17][17]]}
submerged in the ocean even as the horse-headed Dadhyañc hides in a lake
and as the sun-stallion -- the Gandharva in the water, the robber of
waters -- is said to be born out of the waters.

creatures, the god who presides over the offerings to the dead. After
him Yama and Yamī, the twins, were born. But the energy of Mārtaņḍa
Vivasvat was excessive, and with it he overheated the three worlds, with
all that moves and is still. And when Saṃjñā saw the round form of
Vivasvat, she was unable to bear his great energy, and she gazed at her
own shadow and said to her, ‘I am going away to my father's house.
Please remain here unchanged, by my command, fair lady. Be kind to these
two little boys of mine and my fair daughter, and do not speak of this
to my lord.' The shadow said, ‘Even if I am dragged by the hair, even if
I am cursed, I will never speak of your intention, O goddess. Go where
you wish.'

When the fair-eyed Saṃjñā heard this said by her shadow, she went to
her father's house and dwelt there in the house of her father for some
time. Though her father admonished her <<chapter2.html_page_67>>again
and again to go to her husband, she took the form of a mare and went to
the northern Kurus. There the chaste woman practised asceticism and
fasted.

When Saṃjñā had gone to her father, the shadow obeyed her command, took
her form, and approached the sun. And the lord, the sun, thinking that
this was Saṃjñā, begat in her two sons and a daughter. The first son of
these two was the equal of the Manu who had been born before, and so he
was called Manu Sāvarņi [‘Of-the-same-kind' or
‘Born-of-the-look-alike']; and the second son became the planet Saturn,
the slowly-moving. The daughter, Tapatī, was chosen in marriage by king
Saṃvaraņa.

But the shadow did not behave as affectionately to those first-born
children as queen Saṃjñā had behaved to them, who were her own
children. Manu put up with this in her, but Yama could not bear it. As
his father's wife continued to trouble him frequently, he became very
unhappy, and so, because of anger or childishness, or by the force of
pre-deter-mined fate, Yama threatened the shadow Saṃjñā with his foot,
and then the shadow Saṃjñā, full of great resentment, cursed Yama,
saying, ‘Since you threaten with your foot the wife of your father, a
woman who deserves your respect, therefore your foot will certainly fall
off.' Now Yama was much grieved in his mind by this curse, and he, whose
soul was /dharma/, went with Manu and reported it all to his father,
saying, ‘Mother does not treat us with equal affection, O lord. She
shuns us, the older ones, and favours the two younger ones. I lifted my
foot toward her, but I did not touch her body with it, and since I acted
out of childishness or delusion, you should forgive me. Father, best of
those who give heat, since mother cursed me, her own son, in anger, I do
not consider her my mother. For a mother does not behave badly even
toward badly behaved sons; father, how could she say to me, “Let your
foot fall off, my son”? O lord of cattle, blessed
<<chapter2.html_page_68>>one, think of some way by which, through your
grace, my foot will not fall off today by my mother's curse.' The sun
said, ‘Without any doubt, my son, this curse will take effect, since
anger entered into you who know /dharma/ and speak the truth. For all
curses there is some remedy; but there is nothing anywhere that can
dispel the curse of those who have been cursed by a mother. It is
impossible to make your mother's words fail to come true; but I will do
something as a favour for you, my son, because of my affection for you.
Worms will take flesh from your foot and go to the surface of the earth.
Thus her words will come true, and you will be saved.'

Then the sun said to the shadow, ‘Why are you more affectionate to one
among my sons when all are equal? You certainly cannot be their mother,
Saṃjñā, but you are someone else who has come here; for how could a
mother curse a son even among badly behaved children?' She avoided that
question and did not say anything to Vivasvat, and he meditated within
himself and saw the truth. When the shadow Saṃjñā saw that the lord of
the day was about to curse her, she trembled with fear and reported to
him what had happened. Vivasvat became furious when he heard this, and
he went to his father-in-law, who received the Maker of Day decorously
and fittingly and honoured and pacified him who wished to burn him up in
anger.

Viśvakarman said, ‘Your form is hard to bear, for it has excessive
energy. Therefore Saṃjñā is unable to bear it and is practising
asceticism in the forest. You will see your well-behaved wife today
practising great asceticism in the wilderness, because of your excessive
form. I recall the speech of Brahmā, and if it please you, O lord, lord
of the day, I will restrain your form and make it lovely.' ‘So be it,'
replied the lord sun to Tvaṣṭṛ, and Viśvakarman, having received
permission from Vivasvat, placed his spherical form upon his
<<chapter2.html_page_69>>lathe on the island of Śāka and began to cut
down his
energy...^{<<chapter2.html_ipg69_fn18>>[[#page_69.html#pg69_fn18][18]]}

Thus Viśvakarman praised the sun, and he kept a sixteenth part of the
energy of the lord of the day in a spherical form. When fifteen parts of
his energy had been cut away, then the body of the sun was extremely
lovely and charming. And with the energy that had been cut away was made
the discus of Viṣņu, the trident of Śarva, the palanquin of Kubera (the
lord of wealth), the rod of the lord of the
dead,^{<<chapter2.html_ipg69_fn19>>[[#page_69.html#pg69_fn19][19]]} and
the spear of the general of the
gods.^{<<chapter2.html_ipg69_fn20>>[[#page_69.html#pg69_fn20][20]]} And
Viśvakarman made the brilliant weapons of the other gods, for the
quelling of their enemies, out of the energy of the sun. When his energy
had been thus cut away, Mārtaņḍa had a body that was beautiful in every
limb but did not shine with excessive energy.

Then he meditated and saw his wife in the form of a mare, unapproachable
by all creatures because of her asceticism and self-control. And the sun
went to the northern Kurus and took the form of a horse and approached
her. When she saw him approaching she feared it might be another male,
and so she turned to face him, determined to protect her hind quarters.
Their noses joined as they touched, and the
seed^{<<chapter2.html_ipg69_fn21>>[[#page_69.html#pg69_fn21][21]]} of
Vivasvat entered the nose of the mare. Two gods were born in that way,
the Aśvins, the supreme physicians, called Nāsatya and Dasra, the sons
who came forth out of the mare's mouth. These are the sons born of
Mārtaņḍa when he had the form of a horse. And when the seed ceased to
flow [/retaso/ '/nte/, ‘at the end of the seed'] Revanta was born,
holding a sword and a bow and arrows and a quiver, clad in armour,
mounted on <<chapter2.html_page_70>>a horse. Then the sun revealed his
own spotless form, and when she saw that his form was peaceful she
rejoiced. And then the sun, the Robber of Waters, led to his own home
his loving wife Saṃjñā, who had resumed her own form.

Her first-born son was known as Manu the son of Vivasvat, but her second
was called Yama (‘Curb') because of the shadow's curse and Eye of
/Dharma/ because of his father's favour. Yama was greatly distressed in
his mind because of that curse, but since he delights in /dharma/ he is
known as the King of /Dharma/. ‘Worms will take flesh from your foot and
fall to the surface of the earth': thus his father himself set an end to
his curse. And because he has the Eye of /Dharma/, he is impartial both
to the kindly and the harmful. Therefore the Dispeller of Darkness, his
father, the lord, appointed him lord of the south and made him a
World-protector,^{<<chapter2.html_ipg70_fn22>>[[#page_70.html#pg70_fn22][22]]}
the overlord of the ancestors. And the Maker of Day, well satisfied,
made Yamunā a river which flows from inside Mount Kalinda. The two
Aśvins were made the physicians of the gods by their noble father, and
Revanta was made overlord of the Guhyakas.

*INDRA BEHEADS TRIŚIRAS*

One other male twin related to Tvaṣṭṛ is Triśiras, who appears only
in the /Bṛhaddevatā/ version of the Saraņyū myth but is an enemy of
Indra elsewhere in the /Ŗg Veda/. The story is told briefly by Śaunaka.

**** <<chapter2.html_myt20>>20. FROM THE /Bṛhaddevatā/
:PROPERTIES:
:CLASS: calibre16
:END:
Triśiras, who could assume all forms, being a son of the sister of the
demons, became the domestic priest of the gods, from a
<<chapter2.html_page_71>>desire to destroy them. But Indra found out
that the sage had been sent among the gods by the demons, and with his
thunderbolt he quickly cut off those three heads. The head which had
drunk Soma became a heathcock; the head which had drunk wine became a
sparrow; and that with which he had eaten food became a partridge.

*TRITA ĀPTYA AND INDRA BEHEAD TRIŚIRAS*

The Ŗg Vedic verses which tell this tale ascribe the act to Trita Āptya
(an ally of Indra) as well as to Indra himself and relate it to the
other Tvaṣṭṛ myths.

**** <<chapter2.html_myt21>>21. FROM THE /Ŗg Veda/

Āptya, sent by Indra, knew the weapons of the ancestors, and he waged
war. Having slain Triśiras, who had seven rays [or seven reins], Trita
released the cows of the son of Tvaṣṭṛ. Indra struck down the ruler
whose strength was great. After he had driven home the cows of
Tvaṣṭṛ's son, who could assume all forms, he cut off his three heads.

*INDRA SENDS THE BITCH SARAMĀ TO THE PAŅIS*

The motifs of hiding and finding -- applied to the sun, to cows, to
horses, to wives, to water or rain, to the Soma -- combine again with
the motif of the slaying of demons in another episode of the Indra
cycle, in which the mythical animal is not the ‘sought' (the valuable
and symbolic cow or horse) but the ‘seeker', the hunter, Saramā,
regarded in later mythology as a bitch.

*/Saramā drinks the milk of the Paņis/*

The later, explicit version of the tale states clearly the three central
plot elements: the use of a woman to seduce or trick one's enemies; the
voyage, across water, to the other world, where one must not eat or
drink; and the obtaining of the magic elixir.

**** <<chapter2.html_page_72>>22. FROM THE /Bṛhaddevatā/

There were demons named Paņis who lived on the other side of the
Rasā.^{<<chapter2.html_ipg72_fn23>>[[#page_72.html#pg72_fn23][23]]} They
carried away the cows of Indra and hid them carefully. Bṛhaspati saw
this, and having seen it he told Indra. Then the Chastiser of
Pāka^{<<chapter2.html_ipg72_fn24>>[[#page_72.html#pg72_fn24][24]]} sent
Saramā there as a messenger. The Paņi demons interrogated her with the
hymn that begins ‘With
what...',^{<<chapter2.html_ipg72_fn25>>[[#page_72.html#pg72_fn25][25]]}
saying, ‘Where do you come from? Whose are you, fair one? And what is
your business here?' ‘I wander as the messenger of Indra,' replied
Saramā, ‘seeking you and the cow-pen and the cows of Indra, who is
asking for them.' When they learned that she was the messenger of Indra,
the evil-minded demons said, ‘Saramā, do not go. Be our sister here. Let
us divide the share of the cows. Do not be unfriendly again.' Then with
the last verse of this hymn, as well as with the alternate ones
throughout, she said, ‘I do not desire sisterhood or wealth, but I would
drink the milk of those cows which you are hiding.' The demons agreed
and brought the milk. She drank that demonic milk because of her nature
and her inconstancy; the milk was excellent, charming, delightful,
bringing strength and nourishment. Then she crossed back over the Rasā,
which extended for a hundred leagues, on the farther bank of which was
the Paņis' fort, which was hard to overcome. Then Indra asked Saramā,
‘Have you seen the cows?' But she, because of the influence of the
demonic milk, replied to Indra, ‘No.' Furious, he struck her with his
foot, and she vomited the milk. Then, trembling with fear, she went back
to the Paņis. And Indra followed the path of her footsteps, driving bay
<<chapter2.html_page_73>>horses in his chariot; he went and killed the
Paņis and took back the cows.

*/Saramā speaks with the Paņis/*

The hymn to which this myth specifically refers is a dialogue between
Saramā and the Paņis which contains in its imagery the germ of the ideas
which developed into the narrative of later texts. It is interesting to
note that while Saramā vomits forth the actual milk in the
/Bṛhaddevatā/, in the /Ŗg Veda/ the Paņis vomit back words -- for here,
as in the Dadhyañc episode, the magic formula /is/ the elixir.

great treasures, O Paņis. Through fear of being jumped
across,^{<<chapter2.html_ipg73_fn26>>[[#page_73.html#pg73_fn26][26]]}

crossed beyond the ends of heaven. Who would give them to you without a

Bṛhaspati^{<<chapter2.html_ipg74_fn27>>[[#page_74.html#pg74_fn27][27]]}
will not spare you in either case.'

[Paṅis:] ‘Saramā, this treasure full of cows, horses, and riches is
kept secure in the mountains. Paņis who are good sentinels guard it. You
have come in vain on this fruitless journey.'

[Saramā:] ‘The sages -- Ayāsyas, Aṅgirases, and Navagvas -- made eager
by Soma will come here and share this wide expanse of cattle. Then you
will spit back these words, O Paņis.'

[Paņis:] ‘Saramā, since you have come here, compelled by the force of
the gods, we will make you our sister. Do not go back; we will give you
a share of the cattle, fair lady.'

[Saramā:] ‘I know no brotherhood, nor sisterhood with you; Indra and the
dreadful Aṅgirases are my kin. When I left them, they seemed to me to
be desirous of cattle. Paņis, run away from here; run far away from
here, Paņis. Let the lowing cattle come out by the right path, the
cattle which Bṛhaspati, the inspired sages, the pressing-stones and
Soma found when they had been hidden.'

*INDRA SLAYS VŖTRA*

The symbolism inherent in all of the Indra episodes is drawn upon by the
Vedic poet in praising Indra for the greatest of his deeds, the slaying
of the dragon Vṛtra, an act which also symbolizes the releasing of the
waters or rains which Vṛtra had held back, the conquest of the enemies
of the Āryans, and the setting in order of heaven.

*/Indra slays Vṛtra and releases the waters/*

I will tell the heroic deeds of Indra, those which the Wielder
<<chapter2.html_page_75>>of the Thunderbolt first accomplished. He slew
the dragon and released the waters; he split open the bellies of the
mountain. He slew the dragon who lay upon the mountain; Tvaṣṭṛ
fashioned the roaring thunderbolt for him. Like lowing cows, the gliding
waters have flowed straight down to the ocean. Rejoicing in his virility
like a bull, he chose the Soma and drank the extract from the three
bowls. The Generous One took up the thunderbolt as his weapon and killed
the first-born of dragons. O Indra, when you killed the first-born of
dragons and overcame the deluding lures of the wily, at that very moment
you brought forth the sun, heaven, and dawn; since then you have found
no overpowering enemy. Indra killed Vṛtra, the greater enemy, the
shoulderless one, with his great and deadly thunderbolt. Like the
branches of a tree felled by an axe, the dragon lies prostrate upon the
ground. For like a non-warrior muddled by intoxication, Vṛtra
challenged the great hero who had overcome the mighty and who drank Soma
to the dregs. Unable to withstand the onslaught of his deadly weapons,
he who found Indra an overpowering enemy was shattered, his nose
crushed. Without feet or hands he fought against Indra, who struck him
upon the back with his thunderbolt. The castrated steer who wished to
become the equal of the virile bull, Vṛtra lay shattered in many
places. Over him, as he lay like a broken reed, the swelling waters
flowed for
man.^{<<chapter2.html_ipg75_fn28>>[[#page_75.html#pg75_fn28][28]]} Those
waters that Vṛrtra had enclosed with his might -- the dragon now lay at
their feet. The vital energy of Vṛtra's mother ebbed away, for Indra
had hurled his deadly weapon at her. Above lay the mother, below lay the
son; the demoness lay down like a cow with her calf. In the midst of the
waters which never stood still or rested, the body lay. The waters flow
over Vṛtra's secret place; he who found Indra an overpowering enemy lay
in long darkness. The waters, who had the demon for their husband, the
dragon <<chapter2.html_page_76>>for their protector, were enclosed like
the cows imprisoned by the Paņis. When Indra slew Vṛtra he split open
the outlet of the waters that had been closed. O Indra, you became a
hair of a horse's tail when Vṛtra struck at your thunderbolt. You, the
one god, the brave one, you won the cows, you won the Soma; you released
the seven rivers so that they could flow. The lightning and thunder, fog
and hail which he had strewn about did not bring him success, when the
dragon and Indra fought, for the generous one remained victorious for
all future time. O Indra, what avenger of the dragon did you see, that
fear entered your heart when you had killed him? Then, frightened, you
crossed the ninety-nine rivers like a falcon crossing the skies. Indra,
who wields the thunderbolt in his hand, is the king of that which moves
and that which rests, of the tame and of the horned. He rules the people
as their king, enclosing them as a rim encloses spokes.

*/Indra slays Triśiras and Vṛtra/*

In the Vedic hymn, Indra is clearly the supreme god. The one element
that could possibly be to his discredit -- that he fled across the
rivers like a falcon when he feared an avenger of the dragon -- is
glossed over by the Vedic poet, but it is precisely this element which
becomes the central pivot of the Vṛtra myth when it is retold more than
a thousand years later in the /Mahābhārata/, at a time when Indra, the
great warrior, was no longer an object of worship, as his position had
been usurped by the Brahmins' sectarian gods, Viṣņu and Śiva.

Several metaphors and images from the Vedic hymn are acted out in the
Epic. Indra, who was expressly said /not/ to lie hidden in the deep
streams in the Saramā hymn, now conceals himself under water like the
very ‘writhing serpent' whom he formerly overpowered; the dragon who had
fallen like a tree felled by an axe is now cut down by the axe of a
woodsman; the mist which Vṛtra had strewn about now becomes the weapon
which kills him. The episode of swallowing and vomiting forth appears
here twice over: Triśiras would swallow the regions of the sky and the
universe, and Vṛtra actually swallows all <<chapter2.html_page_77>>the
worlds and Indra. The twilight, which plays such an important role in
Hindu cosmogony, appears here as a moment of mediation and ambivalence,
in conjunction with other oppositional pairs including Vṛtra, who, as
the son of the god Tvaṣṭṛ and a demoness mother, is half brahmin and
half anti-god. The celestial nymphs are not successful as Saramā was in
helping Indra to trick the demons, and so brute force is needed. Indra
no longer does the deed himself, but calls upon two assistants, one
below him and one above him: to behead Triśiras he uses a wood-cutter,
to whom he offers the head of the sacrificial animal just as the gods
offer Rudra Paśupati a share; and to kill Vṛtra he invokes Viṣņu.

Tvaṣṭṛ was the foremost of gods, a Prajāpati with great ascetic
powers. He created a three-headed son, Triśiras, because he hated Indra,
and that glorious son, who was able to assume all forms, coveted the
place of Indra. His three hideous heads were like the sun, the moon, and
fire; with one he read the Vedas, with another he drank wine, and with
the third he stared as if he would drink up the regions of the sky. He
was an ascetic, gentle and controlled, devoted to /dharma/ and firm in
asceticism, and he practised severe, extremely difficult asceticism.
When Śakra^{<<chapter2.html_ipg77_fn29>>[[#page_77.html#pg77_fn29][29]]}
saw the ascetic power and spirit of this god whose energy was boundless,
he became anxious. ‘Let him not become Indra himself!' he worried. ‘How
may he be made addicted to sensual pleasures, so that he will stop
practising his great asceticism? If Triśiras becomes yet greater, he
will swallow the entire triple universe.' Thus the wily one pondered
various ways, and then he commanded the celestial nymphs to seduce the
son of Tvaṣṭṛ. He said to them, ‘Act quickly. Go and seduce Triśiras
immediately, so that he becomes addicted to sensual pleasures. With
erotic garments and charming gestures, O fair-hipped ones, seduce him,
please, and set my fear at rest. I feel uneasy in myself, O superlative
<<chapter2.html_page_78>>women. Quickly, girls, allay this sickening
fear.' The celestial nymphs said, ‘We will try to seduce him, Śakra, so
that you will have no fear of him. Destroyer of Armies, we will go
together to seduce him as he sits there, hoarding his ascetic power, his
eyes blazing. We will try to put him in our power and to dispel your
fear.' Then, taking their leave of Indra those superlative women went to
Triśiras and tempted him with various gestures, skilfully dancing and
revealing their elegant bodies. They moved wantonly, but the great
ascetic did not experience an erection. He controlled his senses, like a
full ocean, and when they had tried their best, they returned to Śakra,
king of the gods. They folded their palms together and said, ‘We cannot
shake that unapproachable sage from his firmness. Illustrious lord, you
must do what you must, immediately.' The high-minded Śakra honoured the
celestial nymphs and dismissed them, and then he began to think of a
means of killing the noble Triśiras.

The splendid, heroic, wise king of the gods thought in silence,
determining how to kill Triśiras: ‘I will hurl my thunderbolt at him
today, and he will quickly cease to be. “A strong man must not disregard
even a weak enemy who is increasing in strength.” ' And thus reflecting
upon the wisdom of the textbooks, he made a firm resolution to kill him.
Then Śakra, enraged, hurled against Triśiras his thunderbolt that was
terrifying and horrible as fire. He fell, struck hard by that
thunderbolt, like the peak of a mountain thrown down on the surface of
the earth. But when the king of the gods saw him lying there like a
mountain, slain by the thunderbolt, he found no peace, for he was
blinded and scorched by Triśiras's energy. Even when he was dead,
Triśiras shone with energy as if he were still alive.

Then the husband of
Śacī^{<<chapter2.html_ipg78_fn30>>[[#page_78.html#pg78_fn30][30]]} saw a
wood-cutter working nearby, and the Chastiser of Pāka quickly said to
him, ‘Cut <<chapter2.html_page_79>>off his heads right away; do as I
say.' The wood-cutter replied, ‘He has very great shoulders. My axe will
not go through them. Besides, I cannot perform an action that is
condemned by good people.' ‘Do not fear, but do what I command,
quickly,' said Indra. ‘By my grace, your weapon will be like a
thunderbolt.' The wood-cutter said, ‘Whom may I know you to be, who have
done this terrible deed today? I wish to hear this; tell me truly.'
Indra replied, ‘I am Indra, king of the gods; let this be known to you,
wood-cutter. Now do what I said, wood-cutter, and do not delay. Know
that Triśiras lies here, slain by me.' Then the wood-cutter bowed
humbly, folded his palms together before Indra and replied, ‘How is it,
Śakra, that you are not ashamed of this cruel deed? Are you not afraid
of brahminicide, having slain this son of a sage?' Indra replied, ‘I
will perform some difficult religious act of repentance afterwards for
the sake of purification. This was a very powerful enemy whom I killed
with my thunderbolt. Even now, wood-cutter, I am alarmed and frightened
of him. Quickly, cut off his heads and I will do a favour for you. Men
will give you the head of the sacrificial beast as your share in the
sacrifice; this is the favour I grant you, wood-cutter. But now do what
I wish, quickly.'

Hearing what the great Indra said, the wood-cutter then cut off the
heads of Triśiras with his axe. And when they were severed, from those
heads of Triśiras there came forth heath-cocks, partridges, and
sparrows, in all directions. From the head with which he studied the
Vedas and drank Soma heath-cocks came forth immediately; from that with
which he stared at the regions of the sky as if to drink them,
partridges came forth; and from that head of Triśiras which used to
drink wine, sparrows emerged. When the heads were cut off, the fever
left the bountiful one, who went happily back to heaven, and the
wood-cutter also went home.

When the wood-cutter had gone home, he said nothing to
<<chapter2.html_page_80>>anyone, and no one knew what had happened for a
whole year. But when the year had passed, the ghosts of the bands of the
god Śiva, the lord of cattle, cried out, ‘The bountiful Indra, our lord,
is a brahmin-slayer.' Then Indra, the Chastiser of Pāka, undertook a
terrible vow, and he practised asceticism with the divine army of the
Maruts. He divided his brahminicide and placed it in the ocean, earth,
trees, and women, and he gave them all boons: he gave boons to the
earth, ocean, trees, and women, and thus he dispelled his brahminicide.
Then, purified and worshipped by all the gods and people, the lord, who
was now fit to be worshipped by great sages, returned to Indra's place
in heaven.

When Tvaṣṭṛ, the Prajāpati, heard that his son had been slain by
Śakra, his eyes reddened with anger and he said, ‘Since Indra has
injured my son who was engaged in asceticism and had conquered his
passions, who was always patient, self-controlled, and had committed no
offence -- since he injured my son, therefore I will create Vṛtra to
slay Śakra. Let all people witness my power and the great force of my
asceticism, and let the evil-minded, wicked Indra, king of the gods, see
too.' Then the famous ascetic in a fury rinsed out his mouth with
water,^{<<chapter2.html_ipg80_fn31>>[[#page_80.html#pg80_fn31][31]]}
made an oblation into the fire, created the horrible Vṛtra and said to
him, ‘You are the overpowering enemy of
Indra^{<<chapter2.html_ipg80_fn32>>[[#page_80.html#pg80_fn32][32]]}.
Grow, by the power of my asceticism.' And he grew, towering up to heaven
like the fiery sun, as if the sun of doomsday had arisen. Then he said,
‘What shall I do?' and Tvaṣṭṛ said, ‘Kill Śakra.'

When he had been instructed in this way, Vṛtra went to heaven, and a
violent battle took place as the furious Vṛtra and Indra Vāsava, lord
of the Vasus, engaged in combat. The noble Vṛtra swallowed all the
worlds, for he had been expanded <<chapter2.html_page_81>>by the energy
of Tvaṣṭṛ. The noble Vṛtra stole away all odours and tastes of the
senses, for he took away the entire five-fold material world: earth,
air, space, water, and light. Then the heroic Vṛtra grabbed Indra, the
Performer of a Hundred Sacrifices, and Vṛtra opened wide his mouth and
swallowed him in fury. And when Vṛtra had swallowed Śakra, the
courageous gods of the triple heaven were perplexed and they created
Jṛmbhikā (‘the Yawner') to destroy Vṛtra. As Vṛtra yawned, his mouth
opened, and the Destroyer of Armies came out, making himself small. And
from that time forth, yawning has been inherent in the life's breath of
people.

All the gods rejoiced to see Śakra emerge, and then the long, fierce
battle between Vṛtra and Vāsava resumed. When the mighty Vṛtra waxed
great in the battle, by the power of Tvaṣṭṛ's asceticism, then Śakra
wisely retreated, and when he had retreated the gods despaired and
joined Indra, for they too were dazed by the energy of Tvaṣṭṛ. They
all took counsel together with the sages, stunned by fear, worrying what
to do. They all thought of the noble and imperishable Viṣņu, as they
sat there on the peak of Mount Mandara, wishing for the death of Vṛtra.
The whole universe was pervaded by Vṛtra, so we have heard, and when
Vṛtra had become all the worlds, fear entered Indra. Then Indra, whose
energy was great, took counsel with the gods in order to kill Vṛtra.
Indra said, ‘The entire imperishable universe has been pervaded by
Vṛtra, O gods. Nothing could combat anyone like him. Formerly I was
able, but now I am unable. Please, how can I do it? I consider him
impossible to assail. Shining with energy, noble and of unlimited
prowess in battle, he would swallow up the triple universe with all the
gods and demons and men. Therefore hear what I have resolved, O
heaven-dwellers: let us go together to the home of the noble Viṣņu, and
when we have met and consulted him we will know a means of slaying the
evil one.'

<<chapter2.html_page_82>>Then all the gods and the bands of sages went
to seek refuge with the mighty god Viṣņu. Suffering from their fear of
Vṛtra, the gods said to Viṣņu, the lord of gods, ‘You have crossed the
three worlds with three steps; you have seized the ambrosial Soma and
slaughtered the demons in battle; you, Viṣņu, have bound the great
demon Bali^{<<chapter2.html_ipg82_fn33>>[[#page_82.html#pg82_fn33][33]]}
and made Śakra king of the gods. You are the lord of all people, and you
are inherent in everything. You are the great god worshipped by all
people; O god, foremost of immortals, subduer of demons, be the refuge
of all the gods and Indra, for this whole universe has been pervaded by
Vṛtra.' Viṣņu said, ‘Of course I will do what is best for you, and so
I will tell you the means by which that demon will cease to exist. Go,
with the sages and Gandharvas, to that demon who can assume all forms.
Conciliate him, O gods, and then you will conquer him. My energy will
serve Śakra, for I will enter invisibly into his thunderbolt, that
supreme weapon. O best of gods, go now with the sages and Gandharvas and
make a pact quickly between Vṛtra and Śakra.'

Heeding the words of the god, the thirty-three gods, whose vitality is
great, went with the sages, preceded by Śakra, to the place where Vṛtra
was blazing like the sun and moon, heating the regions of the sky with
his energy as if he would swallow up the three worlds. The gods and
Śakra saw Vṛtra there, and then the sages approached Vṛtra and spoke a
pleasant speech to him, saying, ‘This whole universe has been pervaded
by your energy; you are hard to conquer, but you cannot conquer Vāsava,
whose prowess in battle is abundant, though you two have been fighting
here for a very long time. All creatures, gods and demons and men, are
suffering; let there be eternal friendship between Śakra and you,
Vṛtra. You will be <<chapter2.html_page_83>>happy dwelling in the
eternal worlds of Śakra.' When the mighty demon Vṛtra heard this speech
of the sages, he bowed his head and said to all of them, ‘I have heard
all that you and the Gandharvas have said; now hear me, faultless and
blessed ones. How can there be a pact between Śakra and me? How can
there be friendship between two whose energy is so great?' ‘A friendly
alliance between good people is to be sought after,' said the sages,
‘and after that, what is to be, will be. One should not neglect an
opportunity for alliance with a good man; alliance with good men is to
be sought after, for it is firm and constant. A wise man can give advice
about money to those who are in difficulties because of money; therefore
contact with a good man is like great wealth, and so a wise man would
not injure a good man. Indra is honoured by good men and is the refuge
of noble men; he tells the truth, is high-minded, knows /dharma/ and has
fine judgement. Let there be an eternal pact between you and Śakra; have
confidence in this, and do not disagree.' The glorious Vṛtra replied to
this speech of the great sages: ‘Of course I will respect you, great
ascetics, supreme brahmins. Let the gods do all that I say, and then I
will do all that the brahmins have said to me. Let me not be killed by
Śakra and the gods by anything dry or wet, by stone or by wood, by a
weapon or a thunderbolt by day or by night. Such an eternal pact with
Indra would be acceptable to me.' The sages agreed to this, and when
this pact was made, Vṛtra was delighted. The sages blazing with energy,
having made this false pact between Śakra and Vṛtra, returned whence
they had come.

But Śakra was always on guard, trying to devise a means of killing
Vṛtra, for he was jealous of him. Constantly uneasy, the great Indra
looked for a loophole, for the Slayer of Armies and Slayer of Vṛtra
remembered the treaty that the sages had urged upon him. Then one day
Indra saw the great demon on the shore of the ocean at the moment when
sunset had come, <<chapter2.html_page_84>>a moment both charming and
poignant. The god then thought of the boon that had been given to the
noble Vṛtra: ‘It is now sunset, a dangerous
time;^{<<chapter2.html_ipg84_fn34>>[[#page_84.html#pg84_fn34][34]]} it
is neither night nor day. And Vṛtra must certainly be killed, for he is
my enemy who has taken everything away from me. But he has obtained a
boon, that he cannot be slain even by the gods, so how can I devise a
means of doing it here? If I do not kill Vṛtra now by deceiving the
great demon, whose body and strength are great, I shall not prosper.'
Thinking in this way, Śakra remembered Viṣņu, and then he saw a mass of
foam like a mountain in the ocean. ‘This is neither dry nor wet, nor is
it a weapon. I will throw this at Vṛtra and kill him in a moment.' And
he hurled at Vṛtra that foam with a thunderbolt in it, and Viṣņu
entered into the foam and destroyed Vṛtra.

Now, when Vṛtra was slain, the skies were free of darkness; a pleasant
breeze blew, and all creatures rejoiced. The gods and sages and all the
Gandharvas, Yakṣas, Rākṣasas and snakes praised the great Indra with
various laudations. Vāsava, thus honoured by all beings, comforted them
and rejoiced with the gods, for he had killed his enemy; and, knowing
/dharma/, he honoured Viṣņu, the best in the three worlds. But when the
mighty Vṛtra, who had terrified the gods, was dead, Śakra was
overpowered by falsehood, and he became melancholy, for Śakra had been
overpowered before by brahminicide because of Triśiras. Now the fearless
ghosts of the great god called him ‘Brahminslayer' again, and when the
Slayer of Armies and Slayer of Vṛtra was thus reviled he became even
more ashamed. Then he went to the end of the worlds, his consciousness
destroyed, his wits gone. Overpowered by his own impurities, Indra, king
of the gods, was unrecognizable, <<chapter2.html_page_85>>and he lived
concealed in water like a writhing serpent.

When Indra, king of the gods, had vanished, suffering from his terror of
brahminicide, the earth looked as if it had perished in treeless ruins;
its forests withered away; the courses of the rivers were interrupted;
the lakes were without water; all creatures were agitated because there
was no
rain.^{<<chapter2.html_ipg85_fn35>>[[#page_85.html#pg85_fn35][35]]} The
gods and all the great sages were terrified; the universe, without a
king, was overrun by disasters... Then the gods, with Agni at their
head, took counsel together about Śakra. Those who were clever at
speeches went in dismay to Viṣņu, the powerful god of gods and said,
‘Śakra, the lord of the bands of the gods, has been overpowered by
brahminicide. You are our refuge, lord of gods, first-born lord of the
universe. You became Viṣņu in order to protect all creatures. When
Vṛtra was killed by means of your energy, Vāsava was enveloped in
brahminicide. O best of the bands of the gods, tell us how he may be set
free.' In answer to the speech of the gods, Viṣņu said, ‘Let Śakra
sacrifice to me and I will purify the Wielder of the Thunderbolt. When
the Chastiser of Pāka has performed the meritorious horse sacrifice for
me, he will again become Indra, king of the gods, fearing nothing... For
a certain time, you gods must remain patient and vigilant.'

Hearing Viṣņu's auspicious and true words, as soothing and sweet as
ambrosia, all the bands of the gods and sages and preceptors went to
Śakra, who was agitated by fear. There a great horse sacrifice
dispelling brahminicide was performed for the purification of the noble
great Indra. Indra divided brahminicide among trees and rivers and
mountains and the earth and women, and having thus dispersed it among
beings, the lord of the gods was free of it. Free of fever, purified of
sin, Vāsava became himself again.

<<chapter2.html_page_86>>*/Indra slays Vṛtra and is afflicted by the
Fury of Brahminicide/*

This myth is retold in another part of the /Mahābhārata/, where the
emphasis is placed even more upon the expiation of brahminicide. This
time Śiva is the one who helps Indra to kill Vṛtra, and it is Śiva who
causes Indra to distribute his brahminicide even as Rudra punishes the
sinful Prajāpati and Śiva himself must distribute his own
Brahminicide^{<<chapter2.html_ipg86_fn36>>[[#page_86.html#pg86_fn36][36]]};
even in the first /Mahābhārata/ tale of Vṛtra, where Viṣņu is supreme,
the ghosts who are Śiva's servants force Indra to undergo expiation. The
fever which is mentioned briefly in that version here becomes an
affliction of Vṛtra rather than of Indra, and the yawning episode is
transformed and compressed. Brahminicide now becomes a goddess
incarnate, to replace the goddess of yawning, and a jackal, instead of
Indra, comes out of Vṛtra's mouth. As the two demon-slayings are now
compressed into one, awkward duplications arise: Indra must perform a
double expiation -- a horse sacrifice as well as a distribution of the
sin -- and the birds that were released from Triśiras's head in the
other myth now appear first to circle over Vṛtra's head and then to
pollute Vṛtra's blood. Indra hides in a lotus filament instead of in
water; both are the hiding places of
Agni,^{<<chapter2.html_ipg86_fn37>>[[#page_86.html#pg86_fn37][37]]} who
seeks Indra in the first version and accepts part of his sin here.

**** <<chapter2.html_myt26>>26. FROM THE /Mahābhārata/
:PROPERTIES:
:CLASS: calibre16
:END:
[Vṛtra stupefied Indra by his powers of illusion.] But the divine
Chastiser of Pāka, gathering his wits about him, engaged in great yoga
and dispelled that illusion. When Bṛhaspati, the blessed son of
Aṅgiras, and the great sages saw the great prowess of Vṛtra, they went
to the great lord Śiva and spoke to him, for they desired the welfare of
people and the destruction of Vṛtra. Then the energy of the lord, ruler
of the universe, became a devastating fever, which entered Vṛtra, the
best of demons. And the lord god Viṣņu, who is worshipped
<<chapter2.html_page_87>>by everyone and delights in protecting people,
entered the thunderbolt of Indra...

Now I will tell you the symptoms that appeared in the body of Vṛtra
when the fever had pervaded him. His hideous mouth began to blaze with
fire, and he became extremely pale. His limbs trembled greatly and he
began to breathe hard and fast. His hair stood on end and he emitted
sharp sighs. A dreadful jackal of inauspicious appearance came out of
his mouth: this was his memory. Burning, blazing meteors fell at his
side; vultures, herons, and cranes emitted dreadful cries and circled
over Vṛtra's head, shuddering with delight. Then Śakra mounted the
chariot that the gods had made strong for battle, and he took his
thunderbolt in his hand and looked carefully at the demon. The great
demon emitted an inhuman roar, and as the sharp fever pervaded him he
yawned. Śakra hurled the thunderbolt at him as he was yawning, and that
thunderbolt of enormous energy, like the fire of doomsday, quickly
struck down the demon Vṛtra whose body was so great.

Then another roar arose on all sides from the gods when they saw that
Vṛtra had been slain. And when the enemy of demons, the lord whose fame
is great, had slain Vṛtra with the thunderbolt permeated by Viṣņu, he
went back into heaven. But out of the body of Vṛtra the Fury of
Brahminicide came forth; she was terrifying and hideous, striking fear
into people, for she had enormous, sharp teeth and was frightfully
deformed. She was dark and tawny; her hair was dishevelled and her eyes
were gruesome. She wore a garland of skulls and she was emaciated,
smeared with blood, clothed in rag garments. As she came forth in that
terrifying form, she began to hunt the Wielder of the Thunderbolt. After
a little while, when the Slayer of Vṛtra had set out for heaven,
because of his desire for the welfare of people, she saw him, Indra,
king of the gods, Śakra of great strength. She grabbed
<<chapter2.html_page_88>>him around the neck and held fast as he came
forth out of a lotus filament, for when he had become afraid of having
committed brahminicide, he had entered the middle of the filament of a
blue lotus and stayed there for many years. But Brahminicide had
followed him carefully, and when she grabbed him he became paralysed.
Śakra tried as hard as he could to dispel her, but the lord of the gods
could not dispel Brahminicide. In her grasp, the lord of the gods went
to the Grandfather and honoured him, bending his head, and when Brahmā
realized that Śakra had been seized by the Fury of the slaughter of a
superior brahmin, he began to deliberate.

Then the Grandfather said to Brahminicide, as if to conciliate her with
honeyed words, ‘Angry lady, release Indra, the lord of the thirty-three
gods; do me a favour. Tell me what I can do for you today, what desire
you wish for.' ‘If the god who is worshipped throughout the triple
world, the Maker of the Triple World, is pleased,' said Brahminicide, ‘I
consider my desires already accomplished. But appoint a dwelling-place
for me. You made the moral law, for you wished to protect people, and so
you established this great law and promulgated it. Now, lord god, ruler
of all people, knower of /dharma/, I will go forth from Śakra if you are
pleased; but appoint a dwelling-place for me.' The Grandfather agreed to
this, and by this means he dispelled Brahminicide from Śakra.

But as the noble Self-created Brahmā was meditating there, Agni
approached
him^{<<chapter2.html_ipg88_fn38>>[[#page_88.html#pg88_fn38][38]]} and
said, ‘I have come to you, lord god; tell me what I must do.' ‘I will
divide this Brahminicide into many parts,' said Brahmā. ‘Accept a
quarter of it from me in order to release Śakra now.' Agni replied,
‘Devise the limit of time, when I will be released. This is what I wish
to learn truly, O lord worshipped by all people.' Brahmā
replied,<<chapter2.html_page_89>>‘Any man who is so enveloped in
darkness that he ever fails to make a sacrifice of seeds, herbs, or
juices into the blazing fire, into you, Agni -- Brahminicide will
quickly enter into him and dwell in him. Let this fever in your mind
disappear,
Oblation-bearer.'^{<<chapter2.html_ipg89_fn39>>[[#page_89.html#pg89_fn39][39]]}
Agni, who consumes the oblations offered to the gods and to the
ancestors, accepted the command of the Grandfather, and it transpired in
that way.

Then the Grandfather summoned the trees, herbs, and grasses, and he
spoke to them to the same purpose. When the trees, herbs, and grasses
had been addressed as Agni had been, they became agitated like him, and
they asked Brahmā, ‘Grandfather of all people, what limit will there be
for our Brahminicide? You should not hurt us, for we are by our very
nature injured: we must always bear fiery heat and frost and rains
driven by the wind, and then there is the cutting and breaking, O god.
By your command, we will take this Brahminicide today, but you should
think of a release, O lord of the triple world.' Brahmā said, ‘Any man
who, through delusion or ignorance, cuts or breaks any of you on the day
of the new or full moon -- he will take upon himself this share.' When
the trees, herbs, and grasses heard these words of the noble Brahmā,
they honoured him and went quickly back whence they had come.

Then the god who is the Grandfather of all people summoned the celestial
nymphs and spoke to them with honeyed words, as if conciliating them:
‘Superlative women, this Brahminicide has been taken from Indra; accept
a quarter of it, as I command you.' The celestial nymphs replied, ‘Lord
of gods, we have decided to take it, as you command; but think of a
release from this agreement for us, Grandfather.' Brahmā said, ‘This
quarter of Brahminicide will quickly enter any
<<chapter2.html_page_90>>man who has intercourse with women during their
menstrual period. Let this fever leave your minds.' The bands of
celestial nymphs rejoiced and gladly assented, and they went to their
own places and amused themselves.

Then the god of great ascetic power, Maker of the Triple World, thought
of the waters, and as soon as he thought of them they arrived. They all
assembled and bowed to Brahmā, the Grandfather, whose vitality was
immeasurable, and said, ‘We have come to you, Subduer of Enemies.
Command and instruct us, lord god of gods, great lord.' Brahmā said,
‘This terrifying Brahminicide has come upon Indra who is invoked by
many, from Vṛtra. Accept a quarter of it.' ‘So be it, even as you say,
lord of all people,' said the waters. ‘But you should devise a release
from this agreement for us. You are the supreme guru of the whole
universe, lord of the gods; who else could be a source of grace and
mercy to lift us out of our distress?' Brahmā answered, ‘Any man who,
deluded in his wits, thinks that the waters need not be respected and
casts phlegm, urine, or excrement into you -- this part of Brahminicide
will immediately come to him and dwell in him. This will be your
release; I tell you the truth.'

Then Brahminicide left Indra, king of the gods, and went to each of the
places that had been ordained by Brahmā's command. Thus Brahminicide
afflicted Śakra, who performed a horse sacrifice at the behest of the
Grandfather; for it has been heard that when Vāsava was afflicted by
Brahminicide he obtained purification from it by means of a horse
sacrifice. When he regained his prosperity and slew his foes by the
thousand, the god Vāsava found a joy without equal. From the blood of
Vṛtra cocks were born; therefore these are not to be eaten by
twice-born brahmins or initiated ascetics... Thus the great demon Vṛtra
was slain by Śakra whose energy is immeasurable, slain by means of
subtle intelligence and wily forethought.

*** The degradation of Indra in the later Epics
:PROPERTIES:
:CLASS: calibre11
:END:
The statement that Indra slew Vṛtra ‘by means of subtle intelligence
and wily forethought' must carry at least a measure of sarcasm, in the
context of the myth which has preceded it, a myth in which Indra is
motivated by fear, stupidity, and dishonesty. Even in the /Ŗg Veda/,
Indra's behaviour falls below even the permissive standards of the
warrior, for he strikes Vṛtra in the back; in the /Mahābhārata/ he
openly violates his ‘false' treaty with Vṛtra. By the time of the later
Epics, when brahmin morality had almost totally superseded the warrior
ethics of the Vedas, Indra is actually mocked, though an attempt is
still made to rationalize and justify his immoralities.

*INDRA DESTROYS THE EMBRYO IN THE BELLY OF DITI*

The Maruts, who are Indra's companions in his most glorious exploits in
the /Ŗg Veda/, are the occasion for one of his most dastardly deeds in
the /Rāmāyaņa/, a combination of fratricide, abortion, and incest at a
single stroke. (Indra has already killed a father -- Tvaṣṭṛ -- and
two half-brothers -- Triśiras and Vṛtra.) In this myth, Indra uses his
thunderbolt to tear open the belly of Diti, mother of demons and his own
step-mother and aunt (wife of Kaśyapa and daughter of Daksa, like
Indra's mother Aditi), just as he had used his thunderbolt in the /Ŗg
Veda/ to tear open the bellies of mountains and to kill the mother of
the demon Vṛtra.

**** <<chapter2.html_myt27>>27. FROM THE /Rāmāyaņa/
:PROPERTIES:

:END:
Diti grieved deeply when all her sons had been
slain,^{<<chapter2.html_ipg91_fn40>>[[#page_91.html#pg91_fn40][40]]} and
she said to her husband Kāśyapa, the son of Marīci, ‘My lord, your
mighty sons have killed my sons. I wish to have a son who will slay
Śakra, a son won by my long asceticism. I will
<<chapter2.html_page_92>>practise asceticism; please grant me an embryo
of this kind, a slayer of Śakra.' When Kāśyapa the son of Marīci, a sage
of great energy, heard her words he replied to Diti, who was grieving
deeply, ‘So be it, good lady rich in asceticism. Be pure and you will
bring forth a son who will slay Śakra in battle. If you are pure when a
thousand years have passed, you will bring forth a son of mine who will
slay the triple world.' When the sage of great energy had said this he
stroked her with his hand, said, ‘Farewell,' and went to practise
asceticism.

When he had gone, Diti rejoiced greatly; she went to the Shrine of
/Kuśa/ Grass and began to practise fierce asceticism. As she was
practising asceticism, the thousand-eyed
god^{<<chapter2.html_ipg92_fn41>>[[#page_92.html#pg92_fn41][41]]} served
her most virtuously, supplying her with fire, sacred /kuśa/ grass, fuel,
water, fruits and roots, and whatever else she desired, massaging her
limbs to relieve their exhaustion. Thus the thousand-eyed Śakra served
Diti at all times. And when all but ten of the thousand years had
passed, Diti was highly pleased, and she said to the thousand-eyed god,
‘Only ten years remain for me to practise asceticism, and then you will
see your brother, if it please you, O best of heroes. For your sake, my
son, I will join him to you when he is eager for victory; with him, my
son, you will enjoy the conquest of the triple world, and you will be
without fever.'

When the goddess Diti had said this to Śakra, she lay down to sleep, for
the sun, Maker of Day, had reached the zenith. But she put her feet
where her head should have
been,^{<<chapter2.html_ipg92_fn42>>[[#page_92.html#pg92_fn42][42]]} and
when Śakra saw that she was thus impure, that she had placed her hair
where her feet should have been and put her feet in the place of her
head, he laughed and rejoiced. Then the Shatterer
<<chapter2.html_page_93>>of Citadels, possessor of the highest soul,
entered the opening of her body and cut the embryo into seven pieces. As
the embryo was cut up by the hundred-jointed thunderbolt, it cried out
loudly, so that Diti woke up. Śakra said to the embryo, ‘Do not cry! Do
not cry! [/Mā rudas/]', and he, Vāsava whose energy is great, cut it up
even though it continued to cry. ‘Do not destroy it! Do not destroy it!'
cried Diti, and then Śakra, respecting his mother's words, fell out.
Folding his palms together, still holding the thunderbolt, Śakra said to
Diti, ‘Goddess, you were sleeping impurely, having put your hair where
your feet should be. Taking advantage of this opportunity, I cut into
seven parts the one who would have been a slayer of Śakra in battle.
Forgive me for this, goddess.'

When the embryo had been cut into seven parts, Diti grieved deeply, but
she humbly supplicated the thousand-eyed god, who is unassailable, and
she said, ‘It was my fault that this embryo was divided into seven and
made fruitless. It was not your fault, lord of gods, Destroyer of
Fortresses. I wish to have a favour done to please me: in exchange for
the lost embryos, let them become the guardians of the regions of the
seven winds; let my little sons be the seven kinds of breezes and waft
over heaven. Let my children in celestial form be known as the Māruts,
and let one wander in the world of Brahmā, another in the world of
Indra, and the third in heaven, known and famed as the wind. My
remaining four children will become gods, if it please you, O best of
gods, and wander in all directions as you command. They will be known by
the name of Māruts, which you gave
them.'^{<<chapter2.html_ipg93_fn43>>[[#page_93.html#pg93_fn43][43]]}
When the thousand-eyed Shatterer of Cities and Destroyer of Fortresses
heard what she said, he folded his palms and said to Diti, ‘All will
come about as you have said; do not doubt. If
<<chapter2.html_page_94>>it please you, your children will wander as
gods.' Thus the two of them, mother and son, made an agreement in the
forest of asceticism, and both of them went back to the triple heaven,
having achieved their ends; so we have heard.

*INDRA SEDUCES AHALYĀ AND IS CASTRATED BY GAUTAMA*

Another myth which exalts the power of a brahmin at the expense of Indra
satirizes the widespread mythological belief that the gods must dispel
the dangerous powers of an ascetic by stirring him to lust or anger. In
the myth of Ahalyā, Indra's claim to do this is obviously a thin excuse
to justify his own lust, just as Diti's trivial ‘impurity' must be made
to excuse Indra's slaughter of the unborn Indra-killer. Another bathetic
falling-off from Vedic times may be seen in the ritual animal imagery of
the Ahalyā myth: while Dadhyañc was given a horse-head to replace his
own,^{<<chapter2.html_ipg94_fn44>>[[#page_94.html#pg94_fn44][44]]} Indra
must settle for the testicles of a ram.

**** <<chapter2.html_myt28>>28. FROM THE /Rāmāyaņa/
:PROPERTIES:
:CLASS: calibre16
:END:
The noble sage Gautama once lived in a hermitage that was like a heaven
and was venerated even by the gods. There the famous sage practised
asceticism with Ahalyā for many years. The thousand-eyed husband of
Śacī, knowing that Gautama was absent, disguised himself as the sage and
said to Ahalyā, ‘Calm lady, men who are intent upon getting what they
want do not wait for the fertile
season.^{<<chapter2.html_ipg94_fn45>>[[#page_94.html#pg94_fn45][45]]} I
wish to unite with you, fair-waisted one.' Although she recognized the
thousand-eyed god disguised as the sage, the foolish woman was swayed by
her fascinated desire for the king of the gods and set her heart upon
him. Then, when she was satisfied deep within herself, she said to the
best of the gods, ‘Best of the gods, you have
<<chapter2.html_page_95>>been satisfied. Now go quickly from here, my
lord, proud lord of gods. Protect yourself and me.' Indra laughed and
said to Ahalyā, ‘Lady with lovely hips, I am well satisfied and I will
return whence I came.' And when he had thus united with her, he went out
of the hermitage in confused haste, for he was worried about Gautama.

But then he saw Gautama, the great sage, the bull among sages, entering
the hermitage, unassailable by gods and demons, full of the might of his
asceticism, still moist with the water from the sacred bathing place,
shining like a fire, carrying fuel and sacred /kuśa/ grass. When the
lord of the gods saw him he became terrified and his face fell, and when
the virtuous sage saw the villainous thousand-eyed god disguised as the
sage he said to him angrily, ‘Evil-minded one, by assuming my form you
have done what is not to be done. Therefore you will be impotent.' And
the moment that the noble Gautama said this, the two testicles of the
thousand-eyed god fell to the ground. Having thus cursed Śakra, the
angry sage cursed his own wife as well, saying, ‘You will dwell here for
many thousands of years, eating nothing but wind, with no food, lying on
ashes, practising asceticism, invisible to all creatures; thus you will
dwell in this hermitage. And when the unassailable Rāma, the son of
Daśaratha, enters this dangerous forest, then you will be purified.
Wicked woman, by offering hospitality to him you will become devoid of
greed and delusion, and you will resume your own form and rejoice in my
presence.' Having said this to the woman of evil behaviour, the sage
Gautama of great energy and ascetic powers left that hermitage and
practised asceticism on a delightful peak of Himālaya which was
frequented by Siddhas and Cāranas.

When Śakra had been made impotent in this way, his face was full of
terror, and he said to the bands of sages and Cāranas and Agni and the
other gods, ‘By causing an obstacle <<chapter2.html_page_96>>to the
noble Gautama when he was practising asceticism, and by arousing his
anger, I acted for the benefit of the gods, for I took away his ascetic
power when he uttered his great curse. But in his anger he has made me
impotent and he has transformed Ahalyā. Since I acted to help the gods,
all of you, supreme gods and bands of sages and Cāraņas, should make me
virile again.' When Agni and the other gods heard the words of the God
of a Hundred
Sacrifices,^{<<chapter2.html_ipg96_fn46>>[[#page_96.html#pg96_fn46][46]]}
they went with all the bands of Maruts to the celestial ancestors, and
they said, ‘Here is a ram with testicles; but Śakra has been deprived of
his testicles. Therefore take the two testicles of the ram and give them
to Śakra. The ram, made impotent, will give you great satisfaction, for
men will give castrated rams to you to give you joy.' When the assembled
celestial ancestors heard the speech of Agni they tore out the two
testicles of the ram and gave them to the thousand-eyed god. And from
that time forth, the assembled celestial ancestors have eaten castrated
rams, whose testicles have been used in this way. And Indra has had the
testicles of a ram ever since then, because of the noble Gautama's power
of asceticism.

:END:
AGNI, the god of fire, is one of the most important Hindu gods, for it
is he who carries the sacrificial offering to all of the gods, but his
straightforward function somewhat circumscribes the range of his
mythology. The great Indo-European myth of Agni is the myth of the bird
that carries fire or the elixir of immortality from heaven to earth, a
reversal of his daily sacrificial journey. This image reverberates
throughout the later developments of the Agni myth in a series of
episodes of hide-and-seek, with Agni sometimes seeking but more often
hiding, moving sometimes from earth to heaven but more often from heaven
to earth.

*Agni flees from the gods and hides in the waters*

The Ŗg Vedic source of the myth is, like so many mythological hymns, a
dialogue between opposed figures: Varuņa, god of the waters, and Agni,
god of fire; Yama, god of the dead, and Agni, who wins a full life span.
The waters and plants which Agni enters (and which serve elsewhere as
the receptacles for Indra or for Indra's
sin)^{<<chapter3.html_ipg97_fn1>>[[#page_97.html#pg97_fn1][1]]} are the
/locus classicus/ of the protean fire-water: Agni carries Soma in a
hollow reed just as the Indo-European falcon (or
Indra)^{<<chapter3.html_ipg97_fn2>>[[#page_97.html#pg97_fn2][2]]}
carries fire in a hollow reed, as the Vedic sacrificial fire was thought
to lie dormant in the fire-sticks from which it was kindled, and as,
later, Skanda the son of fire was born in a forest of reeds beside a
river.^{<<chapter3.html_ipg97_fn3>>[[#page_97.html#pg97_fn3][3]]}

[Varuņa:] ‘Great was that membrane, firm was it, which enveloped you
when you entered the waters. One god, O Agni Jātavedas, saw all your
various
bodies.'^{<<chapter3.html_ipg98_fn4>>[[#page_98.html#pg98_fn4][4]]}

[Agni:] ‘Who saw me? Which was the god who spied out my various bodies?
O Mitra and Varuna, where lie all the fuel-sticks by which Agni goes to
the gods?'

[Varuņa:] ‘We searched for you in your various forms, O Agni Jātavedas,
when you had entered into the waters and the plants. It was Yama who
discovered you with your bright light which shines beyond the distance
of ten days' journey.'

[Agni:] ‘It was because of my fear of the role of
Hotṛ^{<<chapter3.html_ipg98_fn5>>[[#page_98.html#pg98_fn5][5]]} that I
fled, so that the gods could not harness me for this, O Varuņa. My
bodies entered into various plants and waters; I, Agni, have ceased to
worry about this matter.'

[Varuņa:] ‘Come.
Manu^{<<chapter3.html_ipg98_fn6>>[[#page_98.html#pg98_fn6][6]]} who
loves the gods wishes to sacrifice. When you have completed the ritual
you will live in darkness, Agni. Make the paths which lead to the gods
easy to go upon; carry the offerings with a benevolent heart.'

[Agni:] ‘The brothers of Agni formerly ran back and forth on this
business like a chariot horse upon a road. Out of fear of this I went
far away, Varuņa. I fled like a buffalo before the bow-string of a
hunter.'

[Varuņa and the other gods:] ‘We will make a lifespan free of age for
you, Agni Jātavedas, so that you will not be injured when you have once
been harnessed. Then with a benevolent heart you will carry the portion
of the offering to the gods, O well-born one.'

<<chapter3.html_page_99>>[Agni:] ‘Ordain for me alone the pre-sacrifices
and the post-sacrifices, the nourishing part of the offering; and the
clarified butter out of the waters and the Man out of the
plants.^{<<chapter3.html_ipg99_fn7>>[[#page_99.html#pg99_fn7][7]]} And
may the life-span of Agni be long, O gods.'

[Varuņa and the other gods:] ‘The pre-sacrifices and the post-sacrifices
will be for you alone, the nourishing parts of the offering. This whole
sacrifice will be for you, Agni; the four quarters of the sky will bow
to you.'

*Agni hides in the waters and is distributed*

The /Bṛhaddevatā/ rearranges the Ŗg Vedic dialogue to form a connected
narrative, but the motivations of the plot are already clear in the
dialogue: like Rudra, Agni demands a share; and like all the gods, he
seeks the immortality of a full life-span. This text then adds another
motif from the corpus of cosmogonic myths and Indra myths; Agni is
dismembered and distributed.

When the brothers Agni Within-all-men, Householder, Youngest, Purifier,
and Son-of-strength had been broken by the
/Vaṣaṭ/^{<<chapter3.html_ipg99_fn8>>[[#page_99.html#pg99_fn8][8]]}
call, Agni Sharp-as-a-needle went away from the gods; so a Vedic text
relates. When he departed, he entered the seasons, the waters, and the
trees. Then the demons appeared, when Agni the Oblation-bearer had
disappeared. The gods slew the demons in battle and searched for Agni.
Yama and Varuna spied him from a distance; the two of them took him and
went to the gods... Agni said to the gods, ‘Let my
<<chapter3.html_page_100>>life-span be long, and let me have various
oblations, and let my older brothers be without injury at sacrifice
after sacrifice. And let the pre-sacrifice and the post-sacrifice, and
the clarified butter and the sacrificial beast in the Soma sacrifice
have me as their divinity, and let the sacrifice have me as its
divinity.' This was granted with the verse ‘This whole sacrifice will be
for you, Agni', and he was made the offerer of good sacrifices, to whom
the three thousand, three hundred and thirty-nine gods gave all these
boons. Then Agni became benevolent in his heart and pleased with all the
gods who had given him the foremost place. He shook his bodies
off^{<<chapter3.html_ipg100_fn9>>[[#page_100.html#pg100_fn9][9]]} and
performed the office of Hotṛ tirelessly, together with his brothers,
for the Oblation-bearer, whose soul was divine, was pleased. His bone
became the pine tree; his fat and flesh became a fragrant resin; his
sinew became sweet-smelling /tejana/ grass; his seed became silver and
gold. The hair of his body became /kāśa/ grass; the hair on his head
became /kuśa/ grass; his nails became tortoises, his entrails the
/avakā/
plant,^{<<chapter3.html_ipg100_fn10>>[[#page_100.html#pg100_fn10][10]]}
his marrow sand and gravel; his blood and bile became various minerals
such as red chalk. Thus Agni and the gods conversed with the three hymns
beginning ‘Great...'

*Agni hides in the waters and curses the fish*

A Brāhmaņa text relates another version of the myth which further
expands the role of Yama, who merely spied in the /Ŗg Veda/ and brought
Agni back in the /Bṛhaddevatā/, but now gives his own immortality to
Agni.

**** <<chapter3.html_page_101>>31. FROM THE /Taittirīya Saṃhitā/
:PROPERTIES:
:CLASS: calibre16
:END:
Agni had three older brothers. They perished while carrying the oblation
to the gods. Agni feared that he too would be destroyed, and so he
disappeared. He entered the waters. The gods wished to find him. A fish
reported him and was cursed by him: ‘Since you reported me, they will
slay you whenever they fancy.' Therefore they kill the fish whenever
they fancy, for he is cursed. They found Agni and said to him, ‘Come to
us and carry the oblation for us.' He said, ‘Let me choose the boon that
when the offering is taken up, whatever is shed outside the enclosing
sticks will be the share of my brothers.'... Agni was in that world;
Yama was in this. The gods said, ‘Let us exchange them'; the gods
invited Agni by offering food, and they invited Yama by offering
kingship over the ancestors; therefore Agni is the food-eater of the
gods, while Yama is the king of the ancestors. He who knows this obtains
kingship and food, for he who knew this obtained the share which they
cut off for Agni, the offerer of good sacrifices. When the sacrificer
cuts off a share for Agni, the offerer of good sacrifices, he gives a
share to Rudra.

*Agni curses the frogs and is distributed*

In the /Mahābhārata/, Agni hides not because he is afraid to carry the
oblation but because he is afraid to carry the seed of Śiva, which is a
multiform of the
oblation.^{<<chapter3.html_ipg101_fn11>>[[#page_101.html#pg101_fn11][11]]}
The fish who betrayed Agni in the /Taittirīya Saṃhitā/ is now replaced
by a frog and by other animals; all of these are cursed to have their
speech distorted in some way, as a fitting punishment for having spoken
out of turn, ‘telling' Agni even as Dadhyañc ‘told' Soma.

**** <<chapter3.html_page_102>><<chapter3.html_myt32>>32. FROM THE /Mahābhārata/
:PROPERTIES:

:END:
The gods and sages wandered over the triple world in search of Agni, for
they all desired the sight of Agni and their hearts were set upon him.
And all the blessed Siddhas, famed throughout the world and endowed with
supreme ascetic powers, wandered over the worlds, but they did not find
the Oblation-eater, for he had concealed himself by disappearing within
himself.^{<<chapter3.html_ipg102_fn12>>[[#page_102.html#pg102_fn12][12]]}
But then a frog, who lived in the water and was scalded and wearied at
heart by the energy of Agni, emerged from the subterranean waters. He
said to the gods, who had become frightened and were eager to see Agni,
‘Agni is living in the subterranean waters, O gods. I have come here
because of the painful heat arising from the Purifier. The blessed
Oblation-bearer is asleep in the water, O gods, but his energy that has
mingled with the waters heats us. If you gods wish to see the lustrous
one, or if you have any business with fire, then go to him there. Go,
and we will flee, for we fear Agni, O gods.' When the frog had said
this, he hurriedly entered the water. But when the Oblation-eater found
out about the treachery of the frog, he cursed him: ‘You will have no
tongue, nor will you know the sensation of
taste.'^{<<chapter3.html_ipg102_fn13>>[[#page_102.html#pg102_fn13][13]]}
Thus having cursed the frog, the lord Purifier went elsewhere to live;
he did not reveal himself to the gods. But the gods did a favour for the
frogs, saying, ‘Although you have been made tongueless by the curse of
Agni, and deprived of the knowledge of taste, you will utter many kinds
of speech. Though you dwell in holes, without food, without
consciousness, even without the breath of life itself, dried up, the
earth will support you, and you will move about even at night when all
is in darkness.'

When the gods had said this to them, they went again over the earth in
search of fire; but they did not find the Oblation-eater.
<<chapter3.html_page_103>>Then a certain elephant, who resembled the
elephant of Indra, said to the gods, ‘Agni is within an /aśvattha/
tree.'^{<<chapter3.html_ipg103_fn14>>[[#page_103.html#pg103_fn14][14]]}
The blazing fire became swollen with anger and cursed all the elephants:
‘Your tongues will be bent backwards.' When he had said this, Agni went
out of the /aśvattha/, for he had been pointed out by the elephant. He
entered the inside of bamboo, but even as he went in he was betrayed by
the steam in the variegated reeds. He left them and entered a /śamī/
tree;^{<<chapter3.html_ipg103_fn15>>[[#page_103.html#pg103_fn15][15]]}
he entered the interior of a /śamī/, for he wished to sleep. But the
gods, whose prowess is truth, were pleased with the elephants, and so
they did them this favour: the gods said, ‘Although your tongue will be
bent backwards, with it you will eat all foods and you will utter loud
sounds with indistinct syllables.'

Having said this, the heaven-dwellers yet again went after Agni. A
parrot reported that Agni had gone out of the /aśvattha/ and had gone
into the interior of a /śamī./ The gods ran after Agni, who cursed the
parrot: ‘You will be deprived of speech.' And the Oblation-eater then
turned around the tongue of the parrot, too. But when the gods saw the
blazing fire, they were filled with compassion for the parrot, and they
said to him, ‘Bird, you will not be entirely deprived of speech. Though
your tongue will be turned around, you will have speech confined to
“ka”, sweet, indistinct, and wonderful, like the speech of a child or an
old man.' When the gods had said this, they spied Agni in the interior
of the /śamī/, and so they made that tree the sacred abode of fire, for
all rituals. From that time forth, Agni is considered to be within the
interiors of /śamī/ trees, and men use it as a means of producing fire.
And the waters of the subterranean regions, which had been in contact
with the deity of bright lustre and heated by
<<chapter3.html_page_104>>the energy of the Purifier when he lay in
them, they release their steam through the mountain streams.

When Agni, the Purifier, saw the gods he became agitated and he asked
them why they had come. The gods all said to him, ‘We would ask you to
perform a task which you ought to do. When it is done, it will bring
great merit to you.' Agni said, ‘Tell me what you wish me to do and I
will do it thoroughly, O gods. I will fulfil your command; do not worry
about
this.'^{<<chapter3.html_ipg104_fn16>>[[#page_104.html#pg104_fn16][16]]}

**** Agni seduces the sages' wives and begets Skanda
:PROPERTIES:
:CLASS: calibre16
:END:
Although in the /Mahābhārata/ tale of Agni and the frogs Agni agrees to
beget Skanda, in other versions of the myth Skanda is merely a fortunate
by-product of Agni's adulterous encounter with the Kṛttikās, the
Pleiades, wives of the Seven Sages who form the constellation Ursa
Major. Astronomical factors are central to this myth, which may
represent the birth of the year (Skanda) with its six seasons (six
heads) during the new moon at the Spring equinox, when the sun is in the
Pleiades (i.e. when Agni is ‘in' the Kṛttikās). The Kṛttikās appear in
two contrasting aspects: they are the loving nurses whose breasts flow
with milk because of their love, and they are the hideous Mothers who
try to kill him; his particular wet-nurse partakes of this latter
aspect, for she is Kālī or Death, the dark side of the gracious Gaurī
who is Skanda's other
mother.^{<<chapter3.html_ipg104_fn17>>[[#page_104.html#pg104_fn17][17]]}
Other oppositional pairs (sun and moon, fire and water) unite to produce
Skanda at a moment of dangerous astrological ambivalence, like the
moment of Vṛtra's
death,^{<<chapter3.html_ipg104_fn18>>[[#page_104.html#pg104_fn18][18]]}
and specific reversals of ‘the pairs', including male and female, take
place at Skanda's birth.

<<chapter3.html_page_105>>Indra is ambivalent toward Skanda: he needs
Skanda to lead his armies, but he fears that Skanda will overcome Indra
himself. Skanda proceeds to justify these fears by shattering several
mountains, including a son of Himālaya -- just as Indra cuts the wings
off all the mountains but Mainaka (another son of Himālaya), Śiva sets
fire to Himālaya, Viṣņu uproots Mandara, and Kṛṣņa uproots Mount
Govardhana (in a battle with Indra).

Agni appears not only in his anthropomorphic form but in several ancient
symbolic forms. He is the Garudī bird who carries the seed, the
Indo-European fire-bird carrying the
ambrosia,^{<<chapter3.html_ipg105_fn19>>[[#page_105.html#pg105_fn19][19]]}
while the ‘goat-headed merchant' is Agni the sacrificial animal, the
goat being his ‘vehicle' in later Hindu mythology. The goat-head is also
associated with
Dakṣa,^{<<chapter3.html_ipg105_fn20>>[[#page_105.html#pg105_fn20][20]]}
who is related to almost all the central characters of this myth: he is
the brother of Army of the Gods, grandfather of Indra, father of Svāhā,
and father of Satī the wife of Śiva (who elsewhere in this same text
replaces Agni as the father of Skanda).

Long ago, the gods and demons were striving to kill one another, and the
demons, whose forms are dreadful, were always conquering the gods. Indra
the Shatterer of Cities, seeing his army being slaughtered by many
weapons, decided that he was in great need of a general to lead his own
army. ‘I must find a powerful man who, when he sees the army of the gods
shattered by the demons, will be able to rescue it by his own manly
powers.' He went to the Mānasa mountain and thought long and hard there
about this matter, and then he heard a terror-stricken cry of distress
uttered by a woman: ‘Let some man come and save me! Let him find a
husband for me or be my husband himself.' The Shatterer of Cities said
to her, ‘Do not fear; you are in no danger.' When he had
<<chapter3.html_page_106>>said this, he saw
Keśin^{<<chapter3.html_ipg106_fn21>>[[#page_106.html#pg106_fn21][21]]}
standing before him like a mountain of red ore, wearing a diadem and
carrying a mace in his hand, holding that maiden by the hand. Then
Vāsava said to him, ‘How can you try to rape this lady, an act which is
not seemly for an Aryan? Know that I am the Wielder of the Thunderbolt,
and stop tormenting her.' ‘Leave her alone, Śakra,' said Keśin, ‘I
desire to have her. Be satisfied if you can return to your own city
alive, Chastiser of Pāka.' As he said this, Keśin hurled his mace to
kill Indra, but as the mace fell Vāsava cut it in half with his
thunderbolt. Then Keśin became furious and threw the peak of a mountain
at him, and when the God of a Hundred Sacrifices saw that mountain peak
falling he split it with his thunderbolt, and it fell to the ground.
Keśin was struck by that peak as it fell, and he let go of the fortunate
maiden and ran away, badly wounded.

When the demon had departed, Vāsava said to the maiden, ‘Who are you?
Whose^{<<chapter3.html_ipg106_fn22>>[[#page_106.html#pg106_fn22][22]]}
are you, and what are you doing here, O lady with a beautiful face?' The
maiden replied, ‘I am the daughter of Prajāpati, and I am known as Army
of the Gods. My sister, Army of the Demons, has already been carried off
by Keśin. We two sisters used to come to enjoy ourselves on Mānasa with
our girl-friends, with the permission of Prajāpati, but the great demon
Keśin tried constantly to carry us off. Army of the Demons desired him,
but I did not, O Chastiser of Pāka; he carried her off, my Lord, but you
set me free by your might. King of the Gods, I wish you to choose an
invincible husband for me.' Indra said, ‘You are my maternal cousin, for
my mother, Aditi, was a daughter of Daksa. Now I wish to hear you tell
me of your own power.' ‘I am a girl without power, O great-armed one,'
replied the <<chapter3.html_page_107>>maiden, ‘but my husband will be
powerful. Because of a boon given by my father, he will be respected by
gods and demons.' ‘Goddess,' said Indra, ‘what sort of power will your
husband have? This I wish to hear you tell, blameless one.' The maiden
answered, ‘He will have great heroic powers, great strength, and he will
conquer the wicked gods, demons, Yakṣas, Kinnaras, serpents, and
Rākṣasas. Together with you he will conquer all beings; such will be my
husband, pious and widely famed.'

When Indra heard her pronouncement, he thought for a long time in
sorrow, ‘There is no husband for this goddess, such as she describes.'
Then he who shone like the sun saw the sun on the Hill of
Sunrise,^{<<chapter3.html_ipg107_fn23>>[[#page_107.html#pg107_fn23][23]]}
and he saw Soma, the illustrious moon, entering the sun, the Maker of
the Day. On this day of the new moon, a dangerous moment, he saw the
battle between gods and demons raging on the Hill of Sunrise. The God of
a Hundred Sacrifices saw the dawn full of blood-red clouds, and the lord
saw the ocean, the abode of Varuņa, full of blood-red water. Then Agni
entered the Maker of Day, carrying the oblation that had been offered
with various hymns by the descendants of Bhṛgu and Aṅgiras. And the
twenty-four
/parvans/^{<<chapter3.html_ipg107_fn24>>[[#page_107.html#pg107_fn24][24]]}
approached the sun; such was the dangerous condition of the moon, which
had united with the sun. Observing the union of the hare-marked
moon^{<<chapter3.html_ipg107_fn25>>[[#page_107.html#pg107_fn25][25]]}
and the sun, a dangerous conjunction, Śakra reflected, ‘A dreadful halo
has appeared around the sun and the moon, boding a great battle at the
dawn after this very night. The ocean is carrying great quantities of
blood against her current, and the fire-faced jackals are howling at the
sun. This dangerous <<chapter3.html_page_108>>confluence is great and
full of energy; this union of Soma with fire and the sun is marvellous,
for a son begotten by Soma could be the husband of this goddess. Agni is
endowed with all these qualities, and he is a divinity; a child begotten
by him could be the husband of this goddess.'

As the lord pondered in this way, he came to the world of Brahmā, taking
Army of the Gods with him, and he bowed to the Grandfather and said,
‘Appoint a great hero to be the husband of this goddess.' Brahmā said,
‘Subduer of Demons, let it be done just as you have been imagining. In
this way a child will be born of great power and wide prowess. He will
be the leader of the army with you, God of a Hundred Sacrifices, and he
will be the heroic husband of this goddess.' When he heard this, the
king of the gods bowed to him in respect and went with the maiden to the
dwelling-place of Vasiṣṭha and the other celestial sages, supreme
brahmins of very great vows. All the gods, following the God of a
Hundred Sacrifices, came to the sacrifice of those sages, for they
desired to drink the Soma acquired by asceticism and to receive a share
of the offerings. When the noble sages had performed the sacrifice in
the proper way, they offered the oblation into the Oblation-devourer
kindled with good fuel for all the dwellers in heaven. The marvellous
fire, the carrier of oblations, the lord, was summoned there; he came
out from the orb of the sun, restraining his speech according to the
ritual. When the Oblation-eater arrived there he took the various
oblations that had been offered by those brahmins together with the
hymns; he took them from the sages and gave them to the dwellers in
heaven.

As he was returning, he saw the wives of those noble sages bathing
happily in their own hermitages. They shone like golden altars, like
spotless slivers of the moon, like rays of the oblation-devouring fire,
like marvellous stars. As Agni saw the wives of the supreme brahmins,
his heart went out to <<chapter3.html_page_109>>them, his senses were
agitated, and he was in the power of desire. But he thought, ‘It is not
proper for me to be agitated. I desire the virtuous wives of the supreme
brahmins, and they are without desire. I cannot look upon them or touch
them without cause, but by entering into the household fire I will look
at them constantly.' He entered into the household fire and rejoiced to
look upon them and to touch, as it were, all those golden women with his
flames. Agni lived there for a long time in their power, setting his
heart on them, desiring those supreme women. But then, as his heart was
still enflamed with desire, Agni went into the forest and resolved to
abandon his body, for he could not obtain the wives of the brahmins.

Previously, Svāhā, the daughter of Dakṣa, had desired him, and for a
long time the blameless and passionate woman had been searching for a
weak spot in him, but she had not seen any in the careful god. But when
she found out that Agni had gone into the forest and was thoroughly
heated by desire, the angry goddess thought, ‘I will take the forms of
the wives of the Seven Sages, and when the Purifier, tortured by desire,
is deceived by their forms I will satisfy his desire. In this way, he
will have his pleasure and I will obtain my wish.' The goddess first
assumed the form of Śivā, the wife of Aṅgiras, a woman of virtue,
beauty, and merit. The superb woman went to the Purifier and said to
him, ‘Agni, Oblation-devourer, you should satisfy me, for I am heated by
desire. If you will not do so, consider me to be as good as dead. I am
Śivā, the wife of Aṅgiras; I decided to come here after consulting my
girl-friends.' Agni asked, ‘How could you know that I am tortured by
desire, and how could all the other beloved wives of the Seven Sages, to
whom you have referred, know this?' ‘Though you have always been dear to
us,' said Śivā, ‘we have been afraid of you. But when we read your mind
by the signs, I was sent to you. I have come here for intercourse;
<<chapter3.html_page_110>>take your pleasure quickly. The Mothers are
awaiting me and I must go, Oblation-devourer.'

Then Agni was overcome with rapture, and he
united^{<<chapter3.html_ipg110_fn26>>[[#page_110.html#pg110_fn26][26]]}
with the goddess ‘Śivā', who was filled with pleasure and took his seed
in her hand. Then she thought, ‘Those who see me in this form in the
forest will falsely say that the wives of the brahmins have committed a
sin with the Purifier. Therefore I will become a Garuḍī bird in order
to avoid this, and my exit from the forest will be easy.' She became a
female bird and went out of the great forest, and she saw a white
mountain covered with reed clusters, guarded by marvellous seven-headed
serpents with poisonous gazes, and full of Rākṣasas and female
Rākṣasas and Piśācas and the fierce armies of Rudra's ghosts and many
kinds of birds and beasts. She went quickly to the high plateau of that
mountain, which was difficult to reach, and she threw the seed hastily
into a golden pot. Then the goddess assumed the forms of the wives of
the remaining noble Seven Sages and satisfied the desire of the
Purifier. But she could not take the divine form of Arundhatī because of
Arundhatī's powerful asceticism and devotion to her husband. Six times
the lustful Svāhā threw the seed of Agni into that pot on the first day
of the lunar fortnight.

The seed shed there, full of energy, engendered a son who was honoured
by the sages as Skanda because he had been shed [/skannam/]. The Youth
had six heads, twice that many ears, and twelve eyes, hands, and feet;
he had one neck and one body. On the second day he assumed a distinct
form, on the third he became a child, and on the fourth day he became
Guha,^{<<chapter3.html_ipg110_fn27>>[[#page_110.html#pg110_fn27][27]]}
with all his limbs developed. As he was enveloped in a great red cloud
ablaze with lightning, he glowed like the rising sun in a great red
cloud. He grasped the enormous bow <<chapter3.html_page_111>>which was
used by the Destroyer of the Triple
City^{<<chapter3.html_ipg111_fn28>>[[#page_111.html#pg111_fn28][28]]} to
cut down the enemies of the gods, a bow that made one's hair stand on
end, and as he grasped that supreme bow he roared powerfully, as if
stupefying these three worlds that move and are still. Hearing that
roar, which was like the sound of a mass of great clouds, the great
elephants Citra and Airāvata sprang up with a start; and when Skanda
whose glory was like that of the newly risen sun saw them hastening
toward him he grasped them with two hands, and with another hand he held
his spear, and with a fourth hand the heir of Agni held in a tight
embrace a powerful red-crested cock with a great body. Then the powerful
one shouted terrifyingly and played on a splendid conch-shell in two
hands, blowing upon it in a manner to frighten even powerful beings.
With two arms he clove the air again and again, and the great general
whose soul is immeasurable seemed to drink up the three worlds with his
mouths as he played on the peak of the mountain like the sun with his
rays on the Mountain of Rising. Seated on the tip of the mountain, he of
marvellous prowess and unfathomable soul looked about in all directions
with his various heads, and when he saw various objects he roared again,
and when people heard his roar they fell down everywhere, frightened and
disturbed in their minds. Then they went to him for refuge, and all
those people of the various classes who sought refuge with the god are
known to the brahmins as the powerful assembly of his followers.

The great-armed one arose and reassured those people, and then he drew
his bow and shot arrows at the white mountain. His arrows pierced the
mountain Krauñca, (‘the Curlew'), the son of Himālaya, and therefore
geese and vultures go to Mount Meru. The shattered mountain fell down,
crying out <<chapter3.html_page_112>>with painful screams, and when it
had fallen the other mountains roared with great fear. Even when the
mightiest of the mighty, whose soul is infinite, heard that roar of the
wounded mountains, he was not at all disturbed, but he took up his spear
and roared. Then the noble one hurled his stout spear, which quickly
split the awful peak of the white mountain. The miserable white
mountain, frightened of the noble one who had wounded him, left the
earth and flew up with the other mountains. Then the earth was hurt,
wounded, and shattered on all sides, and she went to Skanda and became
powerful again. The mountains bowed to him and returned to earth, and
then the world adored Skanda, on the fifth day of the bright moon.

When the great general of great power and courage was born, various
horrible omens arose. There was a reversal of male and female and
similarly of all the pairs of opposites; the planets and the heavens and
the regions of the sky blazed with light, and the earth resounded
excessively. When the sages saw these various horrible omens, they were
disturbed, and they restored peace among people, for they wished for
their welfare. The people who lived in the Caitraratha Forest said,
‘This great misfortune has been brought upon us by the Purifier's union
with the six wives of the Seven Sages.' And others said to the Garuḍī,
‘You have brought this misfortune,' for they had seen the goddess flying
in the form of the Garuḍī and did not know that the deed had been done
by Svāhā. But when the female bird heard it said that he was her son,
she went slowly up to Skanda and said, ‘I am your mother.' And when the
Seven Sages heard that a son of great vitality had been born, they
abandoned their six wives, all except for the goddess Arundhatī, for
those who lived in that forest said that he had been born from those
six. But Svāhā said to the Seven Sages, again and again, ‘This is my
son; I know it is not as you think.'

<<chapter3.html_page_113>>The great sage Viśvāmitra had performed a
sacrifice for the Seven Sages and, unseen, had followed behind the
Purifier when he was heated by desire; he had perceived everything as it
had truly happened. Viśvāmitra first sought refuge with Skanda, the
Youth, and he praised the great general with divine prayers, and the
great sage performed for him all the thirteen rituals for a youth,
beginning with the birth ritual. He sang the praises of the six-headed
one, and he performed a ceremony for the cock, and a ceremony for his
divine
spear,^{<<chapter3.html_ipg113_fn29>>[[#page_113.html#pg113_fn29][29]]}
and one for his assembly of followers. And when Viśvāmitra performed
this ritual for the sake of all people, the sage Viśvāmitra became dear
to the Youth. Then the great sage revealed to all the sages that Svāhā
had changed her form and that their own wives had committed no offence,
but though they heard this told truly, they all abandoned their wives.

When the gods heard about Skanda they said to Vāsava, ‘Śakra, you must
quickly kill Skanda, whose power is unbearable, and do not delay. For if
you do not kill him today, he will become Indra, and the all-powerful
one will seize the triple world, and us, and you, Śakra.' He was
disturbed and said to them, ‘This boy has very great power. He could
attack and destroy in battle even the Creator of Worlds. I cannot kill
the boy.' When Śakra had said this, they replied, ‘There is no manliness
in you, since you can talk in this way. Let all the Mothers of the World
approach Skanda today and kill him, for they can assume whatever heroic
powers they wish.' ‘So be it,' said the Mothers, and they went to him.
But when they saw him, with his unassailable might, their faces fell and
they thought, ‘He is invincible,' and they went to him for refuge. They
said, ‘You are our son; we support the universe. Let us all rejoice in
you as a son, for our breasts are flowing with milk and we are beside
ourselves with love.' The great general
<<chapter3.html_page_114>>honoured them and granted their desires, for
when the lord heard their speech he wished to drink from their breasts.

Then the mightiest of the mighty saw his father Agni approaching, and he
honoured Agni, who remained there together with the group of Mothers who
surrounded him, to protect the great general, the firm one. Skanda's
wet-nurse was the woman, among all the Mothers, who was born of anger;
she held her trident in her hand and protected him as if he were her own
son. The cruel daughter of the ocean of blood, the drinker of
blood,^{<<chapter3.html_ipg114_fn30>>[[#page_114.html#pg114_fn30][30]]}
embraced the great general and cared for him as if he were her own son.
And Agni transformed himself into a goat-headed merchant with many
children, and he played with the boy who dwelt in the mountains,
delighting him with toys.

The planets with their satellites, and the sages and the Mothers, and
all the shining bands of assembled followers, headed by the
Oblation-eater, these and many other terrifying inhabitants of the three
heavens surrounded the great general along with the hosts of Mothers.
The lord of gods, desiring victory but seeing that victory was dubious,
mounted the shoulder of Airāvata and went forth with the gods. Indra
went faster and faster, wishing to kill the great general, and the army
of the gods was terrible and swift, shining with its many-coloured
banners and armour, with various vehicles and bows. When the Youth saw
Śakra, dressed in his best clothes, adorned and enhanced by Prosperity,
approaching him to kill him, he advanced to meet him. The powerful Śakra
shouted to encourage the army of the gods in his path, and he rode
swiftly towards the son of the Purifier, desiring to kill him. Praised
by the thirty-three gods and by the supreme sages, Vāsava came into the
presence of Kārttikeya. Then the lord of the gods, together with the
gods, gave a lion roar, and when Guha heard that sound he roared back
like the <<chapter3.html_page_115>>ocean. At that great noise the army
of the gods wandered about in all directions, here and there, stunned
and senseless, like an agitated ocean. When the son of the Purifier saw
that the gods had come near him in order to kill him, he became angry,
and he emitted from his mouth swollen flames of fire which burnt the
armies of the gods as they struggled on the ground. Their heads and
bodies aflame, their weapons and vehicles ablaze, the gods shone like
bright multitudes of suddenly fallen stars. Burning, the gods sought
refuge with the son of the Purifier; they abandoned the Wielder of the
Thunderbolt and then they found peace.

When Śakra had been deserted by the gods, he hurled his thunderbolt at
Skanda. That missile swiftly struck the right side of the noble Skanda
and split his side. And from the blow of the thunderbolt another man was
born from Skanda, a young man with golden armour, bearing a spear,
wearing celestial ear-rings. Since he was born from the entrance
[/viśana/] of the thunderbolt, he became known as Viśākha. When Indra
saw that another had been born, blazing like the fire of doomsday, he
became afraid; he joined the palms of his hands together and sought
refuge with Skanda. Skanda gave him safety, together with his army, and
then the thirty-three gods rejoiced and made their instruments resound.

RUDRA AND ŚIVA

*** The Vedic myth of Rudra
:PROPERTIES:
:CLASS: calibre11
:END:
ŚIVA only became a great sectarian Hindu god at the time of the late
Epic, a period in which his worship is characterized by many non-Vedic
practices -- notably the worship of the phallus (/liṅga/) and the cult
of asceticism. Nevertheless, his mythology may be traced back to the
Vedas, not only to the god Rudra (whose name remains an important
epithet of Śiva) but to Prajāpati, Indra, and Agni. The earliest
mythology of Rudra-Śiva reveals a process of assimilation well under
way; the dark outsider is already beginning to be included in the Vedic
ritual, but he is still regarded warily, worshipped more in fear than in
the spirit of devotion which came to characterize the later cult of
Śiva.

*RUDRA PUNISHES PRAJPĀTI AND DISTRIBUTES THE SEED*

When Rudra punishes Prajāpati, as he does in the /Ŗg
Veda/,^{<<chapter4.html_ipg116_fn1>>[[#page_116.html#pg116_fn1][1]]} the
gods must first appease Rudra (who is sometimes satisfied with a share
in the sacrifice, just as Agni is) and then they must ‘appease' or
control the dangerous fiery seed. In the Brāhmaņas, this seed is usually
Prajāpati's, but already it becomes confounded with the part of
Prajāpati wounded by Rudra's arrow; later it is the fire from Śiva's eye
which injures Bhaga and Pūṣan, and, still later, the protean substance
becomes the seed of Śiva himself, which, like the seed of
<<chapter4.html_page_117>>Prajāpati, is shed prematurely and remains
destructive until it gives birth at
last.^{<<chapter4.html_ipg117_fn2>>[[#page_117.html#pg117_fn2][2]]}

**** 34. FROM THE /Śatapatha Brāhmaņa/
:PROPERTIES:
:CLASS: calibre16
:END:
Prajāpati desired his own daughter -- either heaven or the dawn. Wishing
to pair with her, he united with her. This was a sin in the eyes of the
gods, who thought: ‘He who does this to his own daughter, our sister,
commits a sin.' The gods said to Rudra, the god who rules over beasts,
‘This one commits a transgression, who does this to his own daughter,
our sister. Pierce him.' Rudra took aim and pierced him. His incomplete
seed^{<<chapter4.html_ipg117_fn3>>[[#page_117.html#pg117_fn3][3]]} was
shed immediately, prematurely. Therefore the sage has said, ‘When the
father shed his seed in his own daughter, he spilt his seed on the earth
as he united with
her.'^{<<chapter4.html_ipg117_fn4>>[[#page_117.html#pg117_fn4][4]]} This
is the chant to Agni and the Maruts, in which it is told how the gods
caused that seed to give birth.

When the anger of the gods subsided, they cured Prajāpati and they cut
Rudra's arrow out. For Prajāpati is the sacrifice. They said, ‘Devise a
way so that this
[seed]^{<<chapter4.html_ipg117_fn5>>[[#page_117.html#pg117_fn5][5]]}
will not be spoilt and so that it will be a small part of the offering.
Take it to Bhaga, who sits to the south of the sacrifice. Bhaga will eat
it as the pre-sacrifice, so that it will be as if offered as an
oblation.' They took it to Bhaga who sat to the south. Bhaga looked at
it and it burnt out his two eyes immediately. Therefore it is said,
‘Bhaga is blind.' They said, ‘It has not been
<<chapter4.html_page_118>>quenched. Take it to Pūṣan.' They took it to
Pūṣan. Pūṣan ate it as the pre-sacrifice, but it knocked out his teeth
immediately. Therefore it is said, ‘Pūṣan has no teeth,' and so when
they prepare the offering for Pūṣan they make it from ground rice, as
for one who has no teeth.

They said, ‘It has not been quenched. Take it to Bṛhaspati.' They took
it to Bṛhaspati. Bṛhaspati ran to Savitṛ to cause it to be born, for
Savitṛ is the one among the gods who causes birth [/prasavitṛ/].
‘Cause this to be born for me,' he said to him. Savitṛ, who causes
birth, caused it to be born, and when Savitṛ had caused it to be born
it did not injure him, and therefore it was for ever after quenched.

*ŚIVA DESTROYS DAKṢA'S SACRIFICE AND DISTRIBUTES FEVER*

Although Rudra is often given a name, or a task, or some other form of
recognition in the Brāhmaņas, he is also specifically denied a share in
the Vedic
sacrifice.^{<<chapter4.html_ipg118_fn6>>[[#page_118.html#pg118_fn6][6]]}
The /Mahābhārata/ myth of Dakṣa's sacrifice is based upon this premiss
and develops into a myth of Śiva's assimilation into the orthodox
pantheon, for in the end he is at last given a share. Śiva's action in
this myth is ambivalent from the standpoint of orthodoxy: by beheading
the sacrifice, he simultaneously /destroys/ it as demons were said to
try to do (he even sprinkles it with blood to make it impure) and
actually /completes/ it as the sacrificial butcher would do; thus he
restores it at the end, replacing the head even as the Aśvins replaced
Dadhyañc's head and learned the secret of ‘how this sacrifice becomes
complete'.

This version is set in the context of the Indra--Vṛtra
myth,^{<<chapter4.html_ipg118_fn7>>[[#page_118.html#pg118_fn7][7]]} and
although Śiva is now clearly a great god, he is still more to be
pacified than to be adored, while Viṣņu appears at the end as a more
gracious god, who forgives the sinners when Śiva would destroy them.
Later versions of this myth further expand this sectarian rivalry and
state <<chapter4.html_page_119>>that it is because Dakṣa is a
worshipper of Viṣņu that he refuses to invite Śiva to the sacrifice.
But here the opposition is rather that of Vedic versus non-Vedic cults.

**** <<chapter4.html_myt35>>35. FROM THE /Mahābhārata/

:END:
[The listener, Yudhiṣṭhira, asked,] You have told me that Vṛtra was
deluded by Fever and slain by Vāsava with a thunderbolt. How did this
Fever appear, and from whence? I would like to hear in detail the origin
of Fever.

[The narrator, Bhīṣma, replied,] Hear the birth of Fever, as it is
famed throughout the world. I will tell you about it at length.

There was once a peak of Mount Meru famed throughout the triple world.
This peak was descended from the sun and was named ‘Luminary'; it was
adorned with all gems, immeasurable, unapproachable by all people. There
on the mountain slope adorned with gold and minerals the god Śiva sat as
if on a couch, shining intensely, while Pārvatī, the daughter of the
king of
mountains,^{<<chapter4.html_ipg119_fn8>>[[#page_119.html#pg119_fn8][8]]}
stayed at his side constantly. The noble gods; the Vasus of great
vitality; the two noble Aśvins, the best of physicians; King Kubera
Vaiśravana, the overlord of Yakṣas, the prosperous lord who lives on
Kailāsa surrounded by the Guhyakas; the divine sages, with Aṅgiras at
their head; the Gandharva, Viśvāvasu; Nārada and Parvata; and the massed
bands of celestial nymphs -- they all came there together. A clear and
pleasant wind blew, wafting various perfumes; the great trees were in
blossom, bearing flowers of all seasons. The Vidyādharas, Siddhas, and
ascetics all came to serve the great god, lord of cattle. The ghosts of
diverse forms, the hideous Rākṣasas and the powerful Piśācas
<<chapter4.html_page_120>>of many forms and various weapons -- all the
servants of the god stood there like fires, rejoicing. The lord Nandin
stood there with the god's consent, holding the blazing trident that
glowed with its own energy. The Ganges, best of rivers, born of all the
sacred waters, incarnate served the god. Thus the lord, the great god,
was worshipped there by the divine sages and by the gods of great good
fortune.

Then, after some time, a Prajāpati named Dakṣa began a sacrifice
according to the Vedic rites ordained in former times. All the gods,
with Śakra at their head, assembled and decided to go to his sacrifice.
Shining like fires, the noble gods in their blazing celestial chariots
went to the Door of the Ganges with the permission of the god; so the
tradition goes. Then the virtuous daughter of the king of mountains saw
the gods setting out, and she said to the god her husband, the lord of
cattle, ‘My lord, where are all the gods going, with Śakra at their
head? Tell me truly, for you know the truth. A great misgiving has come
over me.' The great lord replied, ‘Blessed lady, the supreme Prajāpati,
named Dakṣa, is performing a horse sacrifice, and all the
heaven-dwellers are going there.' ‘Illustrious one, why are you not
going to this sacrifice?' asked Umā. ‘What could prevent you from
going?' The great lord answered, ‘All of this was decided by the gods
themselves: in all sacrifices, no share is designated for me.
Illustrious lady with a superb complexion, by the course sanctioned by
this former agreement, in keeping with /dharma/, properly, the gods do
not offer me a share of the sacrifice.' Umā said, ‘Lord, among all
beings you are supreme in power because of your qualities. You are
invincible, unapproachable because of your energy, fame, and glory.
Illustrious one, sinless one, great sorrow and trembling have come upon
me because you have been denied a share.'

When the goddess had said this to the god her husband, the lord of
cattle, she fell silent with a burning heart, and he
<<chapter4.html_page_121>>knew what the goddess thought and longed for
in her heart. ‘Stay here,' he said to Nandin, and then the lord of all
lords of yoga gathered his powers of yoga, and the god of gods, whose
energy is great, took the Pināka bow and attacked that sacrifice by
force with his terrifying servants. Some of them emitted roars; some
laughed; others sprinkled the fire with blood. Some with deformed faces
uprooted the sacrificial stakes and whirled them about; some swallowed
up in their great mouths the priests performing the sacrifice. Then the
sacrifice, attacked on all sides, took the form of a deer and flew up
into the sky; but the Lord, seeing the sacrifice fleeing in that form,
took up his bow and an arrow and followed it.

As the lord of gods, whose energy is infinite, became angry, a terrible
drop of sweat came out of his forehead; and as soon as that drop of
sweat had fallen on the earth, an enormous fire like the fire of
doomsday appeared. In it was born a short man with extraordinarily red
eyes and a tawny beard; he was gruesome and his hair stood on end; his
body was extremely hairy like that of a hawk or an owl. He had a gaping
mouth with monstrous teeth; he was hideous, dark-complexioned, and wore
red
garments.^{<<chapter4.html_ipg121_fn9>>[[#page_121.html#pg121_fn9][9]]}
That creature of great essence burnt the sacrifice as a fire burns dry
wood, and all the terrified gods fled in all directions. As that man
strode about, the earth trembled violently and a moan of woe arose,
terrifying everyone. The Grandfather appeared before the great god and
said, ‘All the gods will give you too a share, O lord. Lord of all gods,
Heater of Enemies, great god, withdraw this destruction. All the gods
and sages can find no respite from your anger. Supreme god, Knower of
/Dharma/, if this man named Fever born of your sweat wanders among
people, the whole earth will not be able to bear his energy in one
piece; let him be divided into many.' When the god had been addressed in
<<chapter4.html_page_122>>this way by Brahmā, and when he had also been
given a share, he accepted the command of the lord Brahmā whose vitality
is infinite. Bhava, holding the Pināka bow, was well pleased and began
to smile, and he accepted the share that Brahmā had mentioned.

Then he who knows all /dharma/ divided Fever into many parts, for the
sake of the peace of all beings; hear how he did this. The headaches of
elephants, hot exudations of mountains, moss in waters, slough of
serpents, sore hooves of bulls, barren saline patches on the surface of
the earth, blindness of cattle, constipation of horses, moulting of the
crests of peacocks, eye-diseases of cuckoos -- each was called Fever by
the noble Śiva. And disturbances in all sheep's livers, and hiccups of
all parrots, and fatigue among tigers are known as Fever; so we have
heard. But among men, the name of Fever is indeed famous; it enters a
man at death, at birth, and in the midst of life. This awful energy of
the great god is called Fever, and the lord is to be bowed to and
honoured by all creatures that breathe.

When Vṛtra, the best of those who uphold /dharma/, was pervaded by this
Fever he
yawned,^{<<chapter4.html_ipg122_fn10>>[[#page_122.html#pg122_fn10][10]]}
and then Śakra hurled the thunderbolt at him. The thunderbolt entered
Vṛtra and split him, and when the great demon and great yogi had been
split by the thunderbolt he went to the highest place of Viṣņu, whose
energy is infinite. It was because of his devotion to Viṣņu that he had
formerly pervaded the universe, and therefore when he was slain in
battle he reached the place of Viṣņu.

*ŚIVA DESTROYS DAKṢA'S SACRIFICE AND RESTORES IT*

Another early version of the Dakṣa myth combines three Vedic motifs:
the shedding of Prajāpati's seed, the piercing of the sacrificial
<<chapter4.html_page_123>>deer (or of the incestuous Prajāpati in the
form of a deer), and the destruction of the Prajāpati's sacrifice: Rudra
shoots an arrow that pierces the testicles of Dakṣa's sacrifice (now
personified as a man), just as (according to one reading) Rudra's dart
(or the part of Prajāpati wounded by it) is treated like the dangerous
seed. This myth incorporates motifs from the castration of Indra (who is
‘restored' like Kratu), and it leads to the later myths in which Śiva
castrates himself when he is superseded as a
creator,^{<<chapter4.html_ipg123_fn11>>[[#page_123.html#pg123_fn11][11]]}
just as he is here.

**** 36. FROM THE /Varāha Purāņa/
:PROPERTIES:
:CLASS: calibre16
:END:
As Rudra wept, Brahmā said to him, ‘Do not weep [/mā ruda/],' and so the
ancient one became known as
Rudra.^{<<chapter4.html_ipg123_fn12>>[[#page_123.html#pg123_fn12][12]]}
Brahmā said to him, ‘Perform creation and cause it to be diffused with
your own form, for you are capable of this, as you have great
splendour.' As soon as this was said Rudra plunged into the water, and
while he was immersed, Dakṣa performed creation for his own welfare;
while Rudra, the best of the gods, remained in the water, the offspring
that Brahmā had created from his mind performed creation. And while this
creation was being diffused by the overlord of the gods, Dakṣa
enthusiastically began to perform the supreme sacrifice to the
Grandfather.

Then Rudra, who had previously plunged into the water, emerged wishing
to create the universe and the gods. When he found out that the
sacrifice was being attended by gods, Siddhas, and Yakṣas, he was
overcome by anger: ‘What infatuated person has created this universe,'
he cried out, ‘thus insulting this shining
maiden^{<<chapter4.html_ipg123_fn13>>[[#page_123.html#pg123_fn13][13]]}
and overreaching me?' Then the tawny god lamented, and out of his mouth
there came blazing flames, from which were born the bands of low
<<chapter4.html_page_124>>Piśācas and vampires and ghosts, and the bands
of yogis. The heavens were thickly permeated by them, and the earth, and
all the regions of the sky and all the worlds.

Then in his omniscience he made a bow which measured twenty-four hands'
breadths, and he made a three-fold string, and in fury he made two
celestial quivers and placed his arrows in them. Then he knocked out the
teeth of Pūṣan and the eyes of Bhaga and the two testicles of
Kratu;^{<<chapter4.html_ipg124_fn14>>[[#page_124.html#pg124_fn14][14]]}
when Kratu's seed was pierced he disappeared from the sacrificial
ground, taking the path of the wind. All the gods, who were reduced to
the condition of beasts, went to Bhava and bowed to him, and the
Grandfather came there and acknowledged Bhava and embraced the gods who
were full of devotion, for he inspected them and discerned that the gods
had been wronged by Rudra. Then the god of gods looked at Rudra and
said, ‘Father, do not let the sacrifice be destroyed by anger.' When
Rudra heard Brahmā's speech he said angrily, ‘You created me before
these gods; then why have they not given me a share of the sacrifice?
Because of this, I have deprived them of their knowledge and deformed
them, O god of gods.'

Brahmā said, ‘All of you, gods and demons, must sacrifice to Śambhu and
praise him loudly, for the sake of your knowledge, so that the lord
Rudra will be pleased, so that the omniscient one will be pleased.' When
the gods heard his instructions, they praised the noble one... When
Śambhu, the eternal one, the god of gods with his fierce bow, was thus
praised by the gods, he said, ‘I am the god of gods. Tell me what I can
do.' The gods said, ‘Grant us knowledge of the Vedas and sacred books
without delay, and let the sacrifice with its secret doctrines be
restored, if you are pleased with us, lord Bhava.' The great god said,
‘Let all of you together be <<chapter4.html_page_125>>beasts
[/paśavas/], and I will be your lord [/pati/], and then you will obtain
release.' The gods agreed to this, and so he became lord of cattle
[/Paśupati/]. Then Brahmā said to the lord of cattle, with a calm inner
heart, ‘Lord of gods, the fourteenth lunar day will certainly be yours.
Those twice-born ones who, though worthy of being fed, fast and
faithfully sacrifice cows and incense and food to you on that day will
please you so that you will bring them to the highest place.' When Rudra
was thus implored by Brahmā, whose birth is unperceived, he restored
teeth to Pūṣan, eyes to Bhaga, and
seed^{<<chapter4.html_ipg125_fn15>>[[#page_125.html#pg125_fn15][15]]} to
Kratu, and he gave full understanding to the immortals. Thus was the
birth of Rudra formerly brought about by Brahmā, and because of this act
Rudra became known as the lord of gods. And whatever man hears this and
always arises at dawn, he is released from all sins and obtains the
world of Rudra.

*** The Epic myth of the destruction of the triple city of the demons
:PROPERTIES:
:CLASS: calibre11
:END:
This is a myth of cosmic destruction by means of combining disparate
elements, the mirror image of the myth of cosmic creation by means of
dismemberment.^{<<chapter4.html_ipg125_fn16>>[[#page_125.html#pg125_fn16][16]]}
To separate and put in order is to create, in this context; to cause
oppositional pairs to unite, and thus to lose their separate identities,
is to produce chaos and annihilation, just as the total fusion of
positive and negative atomic particles (or of ‘matter' and
‘anti-matter') results in an atomic explosion. The chariot which the
gods create in order for Śiva to destroy the triple cities (i.e. the
triple worlds of the universe -- heaven, sky, and earth) is made by
reassembling all the elements, animate and inanimate, abstract and
concrete, which were so carefully dispersed and labelled at the time of
primeval
creation.^{<<chapter4.html_ipg125_fn17>>[[#page_125.html#pg125_fn17][17]]}

<<chapter4.html_page_126>>Although Śiva explicitly restrains his fire
from reducing everything to ashes at the end of the myth, it is clear
that this is merely a temporary postponement of the inevitable
conflagration, for Śiva's weapon is Time, Doomsday. This destruction is
regarded as a favour to the demons who explicitly ask to be killed by
Rudra, even as Rudra brings periodic universal dissolution as a favour
to all beings. The necessity of death is expressed in the sub-episode of
the magic lake which revives the dead demons; this lake is against the
rules of Hindu metaphysics (as Brahmā says to the demons, ‘There is no
complete immortality'), and it makes the virtuous demons become corrupt.
These three related themes -- that immortality corrupts, that virtuous
enemies must be corrupted so that they can be killed, and that the gods
must steal from the demons their secret revivifying magic -- are at the
heart of the mythology of the battle between gods and
demons.^{<<chapter4.html_ipg126_fn18>>[[#page_126.html#pg126_fn18][18]]}

The imagery of the myth of the triple cities is Vedic: the three demons
are the descendants of the triple-headed son of Vṛtra; the bow and
arrow are the weapons which Rudra used against Prajāpati; and the
villain of the piece is Maya, the architect of the demons and thus the
demonic counterpart of Tvaṣṭṛ, who constructs the chariot for the
gods. The charioteer is the Sūta, a cross between warrior and priest, a
combination of body-guard, panegyrist, and counsellor; he reappears
often in Hindu mythology, notably in the /Bhagavad Gītā/, which is a
conversation between the archer Arjuna and his charioteer, Kṛṣņa.

**** <<chapter4.html_myt37>>37. FROM THE /Mahābhārata/
:PROPERTIES:
:CLASS: calibre16
:END:
There was a great conflict between the gods and demons, in which the
first battle destroyed the demon
Tāraka;^{<<chapter4.html_ipg126_fn19>>[[#page_126.html#pg126_fn19][19]]}
the demons were then conquered by the gods, we have heard.
<<chapter4.html_page_127>>But when the demons had been conquered, the
three sons of Tārāka, who were Tārākṣa, Kamalākṣa, and
Vidyunmālin,^{<<chapter4.html_ipg127_fn20>>[[#page_127.html#pg127_fn20][20]]}
undertook fierce asceticism, observing the highest vow, wasting away
their bodies with asceticism. The Grandfather, giver of boons, was
pleased by their self-restraint, asceticism, and vow, and he granted
them boons. They all asked the Grandfather of all people to ordain that
they could not be slain by any creatures, ever. The lord god, lord of
the worlds, said to them, ‘There is no complete immortality. Therefore,
demons, withdraw this request and choose another boon that is pleasing
to you.' When they had all deliberated together for a long time, over
and over again, they bowed to the lord of all people and recited this
speech to him: ‘Grandfather, faultless god, grant us the boon that we
may establish three cities upon the earth and wander over this world, by
your grace. Then, after a thousand years, we will come together and
these cities will become one, and the blessed lord, the best of gods,
will destroy these united cities with a single arrow, and that will be
our death.' The god agreed to this and entered heaven.

When they had obtained their wishes, they deliberated happily together
and chose the great demon Maya to create their three cities, for Maya
was the wise, unaging Viśvakarman worshipped by demons. By his own
ascetic power he created three cities, one of gold, one of silver, and
the third of black iron. The gold city was in heaven, the silver in the
air, and the iron city was set on a disc on earth. Each one was a
hundred leagues wide and a hundred leagues long, with houses and high
mansions with terraces and roof gardens, with many walls and ornamental
gates. Though closely packed with all kinds of houses, adorned with
various palaces and gateways, each city was spacious and airy. There was
a separate king in <<chapter4.html_page_128>>each separate city: the
sparkling city of gold belonged to the noble Tārakākṣa; the silver was
Kamalākṣa's, and the iron Vidyunmālin's. The three demon kings soon
overwhelmed the three worlds with their energy and ruled for many yean,
by the grace of Prajāpati. Then millions, and tens of millions, and
hundreds of millions of demon chiefs with invincible heroism, desiring
great sovereignty, came together from all sides to take refuge in the
fortified triple city. Maya supplied everything that they all needed,
and, relying upon him, they all dwelt there fearing nothing. Whenever
anyone living in the triple city thought of any wish, Maya immediately
fulfilled that wish, by his magic powers.

Tārakākṣa had a powerful son named Hari, who satisfied the Grandfather
with his extreme asceticism and asked the gratified god for a boon: ‘Let
there be in our city a lake, such that those who have been wounded by
weapons become more powerful when they are thrown into it.' When the
heroic Hari, son of Tārakākṣa, had obtained this boon, he created there
a lake that revived the dead. In whatever form or clothing a demon died,
when he had been thrown into the lake he came to life in the same form
and clothing. When the inhabitants of the triple city had obtained that
lake, achieving supernatural powers through their great asceticism, they
oppressed all the worlds and augmented the fears of the gods, for they
never suffered any loss in battle. Then they were overcome by greed and
infatuation and they lost their wits; shamelessly they all plundered
established civilization. Routing the gods and their attendants here and
there, now and again, filled with pride because of the boon they had
been given, they roamed at will over all the forests of the gods that
were cherished by the inhabitants of heaven. They destroyed the sacred
hermitages of the sages, and the sacrificial posts, and the countryside;
the wicked demons violated all moral bounds.

<<chapter4.html_page_129>>When all the worlds were thus oppressed,
Śakra, surrounded by the Maruts, attacked the cities on all sides by
hurling his thunderbolts. But the Shatterer of Cities could not pierce
those cities, which had been made impenetrable by the boon given by the
Creator. Then the lord of the gods became afraid, and he left those
cities, and all the gods went together to the Grandfather to tell him of
the injury done by the enemies of the gods. They told him everything
truly and bowed to him with their heads and asked the blessed lord, the
Grandfather, for a means of slaughter. When the god heard this he said
to the gods, ‘These evil demons who hate the gods offend you constantly
and oppress you. I am certainly impartial to all creatures, but I tell
you these offenders against /dharma/ must be killed. These fortresses
can be pierced by a single arrow, but not otherwise; and no one but
Sthāņu can pierce the forts with a single arrow. Gods, choose as your
warrior the lord Sthāņu the Vanquisher, who is never wearied by any
task, and he will kill the enemies of the gods.'

When the gods, led by Śakra, heard this speech, they went with Brahmā to
seek refuge with the god Śiva whose symbol is the bull. The gods, who
knew /dharma/, practised great asceticism and proclaimed the eternal
Vedas, and together with the sages they went to Bhava with their whole
souls. They praised with well-chosen words the one who grants safety
from all dangers, the soul of all, the noble one who pervades everything
with his self. They saw him who by many special acts of asceticism
learned his yoga of the self, who knows the Sāṅkhya of the self, who
holds the self in his power, who is the lord, a mass of energy, the
husband of Umā, unlike any other in the world, the undefiled performer
of vows. They had imagined the one lord to be of various forms, but when
they saw in the noble one the forms and images of themselves and each
other, they were all amazed. And when they saw the unborn lord, lord of
the universe, the very substance of all
<<chapter4.html_page_130>>creatures, the gods and priestly sages touched
the ground with their heads.

The lord Śaṅkara welcomed them, arose, smiled and said, ‘Tell me, tell
me.' When they were thus encouraged by the three-eyed god, though their
minds were uneasy they said to Bhava, ‘Honour, honour to you; we bow to
you, O lord...' Then the Lord was pleased, and he welcomed them with
salutation and said, ‘Do not fear. Tell me, what can I do for you?' When
the noble one had offered this boon to the throngs of ancestors, gods,
and sages, Brahmā honoured Śaṅkara and said these words for the benefit
of the world: ‘By your permission, lord of gods, I was appointed to this
position of Prajāpati, and when I was thus appointed I gave a great boon
to the demons. No one but you, lord of all that has been and is to be,
is able to destroy them now that they have transgressed all moral
bounds; you can oppose them in the slaughter. O god, lord of gods, show
your grace to the heaven-dwellers who have come to beg you: kill the
demons, O Bearer of the Trident.' The blessed lord replied, ‘All of your
enemies are to be slain; this is my opinion. But I am not able, all
alone, to slay those who hate the gods. All of you, together, must slay
your enemies in battle, by means of a weapon made of my energy, for
unity is great strength.' ‘Their power and energy is double the strength
of ours,' said the gods; ‘this is what we think, and we have seen their
power and energy.' The lord said, ‘Those evil ones who have offended you
must be slain altogether. Kill all of these enemies with a half of my
power and energy.' The gods answered, ‘Great lord, we will not be able
to bear a half of your energy. But with a half of all of our power,
/you/ must slay the enemy.'

The lord of gods granted their request and took half of the energy from
all of them and became greater. With that power the god became more
powerful than all of them, and thenceforth Śaṅkara was known as the
Great God. Then the Great <<chapter4.html_page_131>>God said, ‘I will
take my bow and arrow and chariot and I will slay in combat those
enemies of the inhabitants of heaven. You must see to my chariot and to
my bow and arrow so that this very day I will cause the enemy to fall
upon the surface of the earth.' ‘We will gather all the forms in the
triple world from here and there to make your chariot of great strength,
O lord of gods,' said the gods, ‘and Viśvakarman will make the
auspicious chariot, designing it cunningly.' Then they who were like
tigers among the gods fashioned that chariot, and they made his arrow
out of Viṣņu and Soma and the Oblation-eater: Agni became its shaft,
Soma its head, and Viṣņu the point of that supreme arrow.

They made the body of the chariot out of the goddess Earth, garlanded
with spacious cities, the supporter of all creatures, with her mountains
and forests and islands. Mount Mandara was its axle; the great rivers
were made its shanks; the regions of the sky and the intermediary
directions were its cover. The dynasty of constellations became its
shaft; the Krta Age became its
yoke.^{<<chapter4.html_ipg131_fn21>>[[#page_131.html#pg131_fn21][21]]}
The supreme snake Vāsuki became the pole to which the yoke is fixed. The
mountains Himālaya and Vindhya became appendages to the wheels; the gods
made the Hill of Rising and the Hill of Setting into the two wheels.
They made the ocean, the supreme abode of demons, into the other axle,
and they made the circle of the Seven Sages into the decoration of the
chariot wheels. The Ganges, Sarasvatī, Sindhu, and the sky were its axle
pins; and all the mountain streams were the ornaments of the chariot.
Day and night, and all the minutes and seconds, and the seasons adorned
it. The shining planets were its under-carriage, and the stars were its
wooden fender. Dharma, Artha, and
<<chapter4.html_page_132>>Kāma^{<<chapter4.html_ipg132_fn22>>[[#page_132.html#pg132_fn22][22]]}
conjoined as its tripartite curved pole; the various herbs and all
species of flowers, fruits, and shoots were its bells. The sun and moon
they made into the two supreme wheels, and night and day were made into
its two splendid wings in front and back. They made the ten lords of
snakes, led by Dhṛtarāṣṭra, into its strong shaft; the sky was its
yoke, and the two clouds of
doomsday^{<<chapter4.html_ipg132_fn23>>[[#page_132.html#pg132_fn23][23]]}
were made into the leather thongs of the yoke. The pins of the yoke were
Fortitude, Memory, Steadfastness, and Humility; the animal
skin^{<<chapter4.html_ipg132_fn24>>[[#page_132.html#pg132_fn24][24]]}
was the firmament spangled with the planets and constellations and
stars.

The
World-protectors,^{<<chapter4.html_ipg132_fn25>>[[#page_132.html#pg132_fn25][25]]}
the rulers of the gods, water, the dead, and wealth, were made into the
horses, and the snakes Kālapṛṣṭha, Nahuṣa, Karkoṭaka, Dhanañjaya
and others became bands to bind the manes of the horses. The day
preceding the new moon, the day after the full moon, the day of the new
moon and the day of the full moon -- these auspicious days they made the
traces of the horses and the riders and the leather neck-strap. Action,
truth, asceticism, and profit were made the reins; mind was the base,
and speech the chariot's path. Banners of various hues and patterns
fluttered in the wind, and the chariot shone forth brilliantly, as it
was girded with lightning and rainbows.

The gods were amazed when they saw the chariot formed in this way, for
they saw that the energies of all the world were
<<chapter4.html_page_133>>united, and they reported to the noble god
that it was ready. When the supreme chariot had been thus fashioned by
the gods to wipe out those who hated them, Śaṅkara placed his own
superior weapons in the chariot. He made the sky his chariot staff and
placed his bull upon its banner. The rod of Brahmā, the rod of death,
the rod of Rudra, and Fever became the outriders of that chariot,
watching in all directions.
Atharvan^{<<chapter4.html_ipg133_fn26>>[[#page_133.html#pg133_fn26][26]]}
and Aṅgiras protected the wheels of the noble chariot, and the /Ŗg
Veda, Sāma Veda/, and /Purāņa/ rode in front, while the
/Itihāsa/^{<<chapter4.html_ipg133_fn27>>[[#page_133.html#pg133_fn27][27]]}
and the /Yajur Veda/ protected the rear. Sacred words and sciences were
made servants standing on all sides. The sound /Vaṣaṭ/ was made into
the whip, and the sound /Om/ shone forth surpassingly at the head of the
car. Having made the year embroidered with the six seasons his bow, he
made his own shadow the bow string, unbreakable in battle. For the lord
Rudra is Time and Death, and the year is his bow, and therefore the
Night of Doomsday for men was made the unwithering string of that bow.
Viṣņu, the blazing Agni, and Soma were the arrow, for this whole
universe is made of Agni and Soma, and the universe is said to be made
of Viṣņu, and Viṣņu is the soul of the lord Bhava of infinite energy.
Therefore they cannot bear it when Hara touches that bowstring. The lord
cast onto that arrow his unbearable, sharp anger, the fire of anger,
born of the anger of Bhṛgu and Aṅgiras, which is very hard to bear.

The red and blue one, the smoky one, the Wearer of Skins, the Terrifier
blazed forth enveloped in flames of energy like ten thousand suns. He
who hurls down those who are hard to <<chapter4.html_page_134>>hurl
down, the conqueror and slayer of those who hate religion, Hara, the
eternal saviour of those people who follow /dharma/ and the eternal
slaughterer of those who follow /adharma/, the lord Sthāņu was
surrounded by his hideous, terrifying, fierce and destructive bands of
servants as if surrounded by his own qualities. This whole universe,
moving and still, entered into his limbs and presented a marvellous
sight. When he saw the divine chariot, he put on his armour and took up
his bow and the celestial arrow born of Soma, Viṣņu, and Agni, and the
gods made the feathers of that arrow out of a fragrant, gentle breeze.
The great god mounted the chariot and made ready, terrifying even the
gods and causing heaven and earth to tremble.

The brilliant Giver of Boons, the god armed with his sword and bow and
arrow, laughed and said, ‘Who will be my charioteer?' The bands of gods
replied, ‘Whomever you appoint, he will certainly be your charioteer, O
lord of gods.' Then the god spoke again to them, saying, ‘Deliberate
briefly and make him my charioteer who is better than me.' When the gods
heard this speech uttered by the noble one, they went to the Grandfather
and begged his favour: ‘God, we have done precisely as you instructed
regarding the annihilation of the enemies of the thirty-three gods. We
have propitiated him whose banner is the bull and we have made the
chariot and equipped it with various weapons. But we do not know who
could be the charioteer for this supreme chariot. Therefore, O lord god,
appoint someone to be charioteer; make fruitful the words that you spoke
to us when you said, “I will do what is for your benefit.” Now you
should keep that promise. The supreme chariot is ready for us, O god; it
is an unassailable router of enemies; and the god who holds the Pināka
bow in his hand has been designated the warrior for it and is girded and
eager, terrifying the demons. The four Vedas are its fine horses; the
earth with her mountains <<chapter4.html_page_135>>is the noble chariot;
the cluster of constellations is the wooden fender on which the warrior
should be protected by the charioteer. A charioteer must be sought who
excels all these, for upon him depend the chariot, the horses, the
armour, weapons, bow, and even the warrior. O lord god, Grandfather, we
can see no charioteer for this other than you, for you have all the
qualities and are the foremost of gods. Mount the chariot quickly and
rein in the supreme horses.' Then the gods bowed their heads to the lord
of the triple world, the Grandfather, begging him to be their
charioteer; so we have heard. Brahmā replied, ‘There is not a word of
falsehood in all that you have said, O dwellers in heaven. I will rein
in the horses for Śiva, whose hair is braided, when he fights.' Then the
lord god, Creator of the Worlds, the Grandfather, was appointed by the
gods to be the charioteer for the noble lord Śiva.

When Brahmā mounted that chariot which was worshipped by all the world,
the horses swift as the wind quickly bowed their heads, and when the
great lord Śiva had mounted, they went down on their knees. Then the
great Grandfather, the lord of the triple world, took up the reins and
drove those horses that were as swift as thought or the wind. And when
Brahmā, the giver of boons, had mounted and driven toward the demons,
Śiva, the lord of all, smiled and said, ‘Well done! Well done! Drive on,
O lord; drive the horses tirelessly to the place where the demons are.
Witness today the might of my two arms as I kill our enemies in battle.'
Then he drove those horses swift as a blast of wind to the triple city
that was protected by the demons. The lord went quickly to win victory
for the dwellers in the triple heaven, driving the horses worshipped by
all the world, horses which seemed to drink up the skies.

When Bhava set out toward the triple city in the chariot, the bull
bellowed a great roar that filled the regions of the
<<chapter4.html_page_136>>sky. Hearing that great and terrifying roar of
the bull, some of the descendants of Tāraka, enemies of the gods, were
destroyed on the spot; others stood there ready to face battle. Then
Sthāņu, bearing the trident, went mad with anger; all creatures were
terrified, and the triple world trembled. Dreadful omens arose as he
placed his arrow on the bowstring, for, because of the excitement of
Soma, Agni, and Viṣņu in it, as also of Brahmā and Rudra, and because
of the vibration of the bow, the chariot sank down badly. Then
Nārāyaņa^{<<chapter4.html_ipg136_fn28>>[[#page_136.html#pg136_fn28][28]]}
came forth out of the arrow and assumed the form of a bull and raised up
the great chariot. But while the chariot was sinking and the enemies
were bellowing, in all the confusion, the mighty lord stood on the head
of the bull and on the back of a horse and roared. The lord Rudra looked
at the city of the demons and he cut off the breasts of the horse and
clove in two the hooves of the bull. And from that time forth, the
hooves of cattle are cloven, and from that time forth horses have had no
breasts, for they were wounded by the mighty Rudra of marvellous deeds.

Then Śarva strung his bow and placed his arrow on it and strengthened it
with the magic weapon of the lord of cattle, and he thought of the
triple city. And as he stood there, angrily holding his bow, at that
moment the three cities became one, and when the triple city had become
one, a great hubbub of joy arose among the noble gods. Then all the
bands of gods and the Siddhas and supreme sages shouted, ‘Victory!',
praising and rejoicing. The triple city then appeared before the slayer
of demons, the god whose form was indescribably fierce, whose energy was
unbearable. The lord of all the world drew his bow and released against
the triple city the arrow which was the essence of the triple world. It
burnt the band of demons and hurled them into the western
<<chapter4.html_page_137>>ocean.^{<<chapter4.html_ipg137_fn29>>[[#page_137.html#pg137_fn29][29]]}
Thus the triple city was burnt, and all the demons without exception
were burnt by the Great Lord in his anger, for he wished for the welfare
of the triple world.

The three-eyed god restrained the fire which was born of his own anger,
saying to it, ‘Alas! Do not reduce the worlds to ashes.' Then all the
gods and people and sages resumed their natural state and praised with
significant words Sthāņu whose vitality is incomparable. And then,
having been given permission to leave by the lord, whom they had
propitiated, all the gods, led by Prajāpati, went back whence they had
come, for their desires were fulfilled.

*** The Purāņic myths of /liṅga/-worship
:PROPERTIES:
:CLASS: calibre11
:END:
The most important form of the cult of Śiva is the worship of the
/liṅga/ or phallus of Śiva, a practice which may be traced back to the
pre-Vedic societies of the Indus Valley civilization (/c./ 2000 B.C.)
but which first appears in Hindu iconography in the second century B.C.
Myths explaining the origin of /liṅga/-worship occur in the latest
layers of the Epics and are then widespread, probably because of the
need to justify this non-Vedic aspect of the god, which had been only
recently assimilated to orthodox Hinduism.

*ŚIVA CASTRATES HIMSELF*

Like the story of Dakṣa's sacrifice, this is a myth of antagonism and
competition between gods in which Śiva terrorizes the other gods into
worshipping him, first with a share of the Vedic sacrifice and here with
devotion to the /liṅga./ In the Dakṣa myth, Śiva and Dakṣa compete as
creators; here, Viṣņu gives Brahmā the same command which Brahmā had
given to
Rudra^{<<chapter4.html_ipg137_fn30>>[[#page_137.html#pg137_fn30][30]]}
(‘Create progeny, for you are <<chapter4.html_page_138>>capable'), but,
unlike Rudra, Brahmā obeys this command and ‘overreaches' Śiva just as
his son Dakṣa did. This conflict is then resolved into an opposition
between Brahmā the creator and Śiva the destroyer, for Śiva's
destructive aspect is emphasized from the very beginning of this myth.
Just as Viṣņu mediates between Śiva and Brahmā, so on the symbolic
level wind mediates between fire and water during both destruction and
creation.

**** <<chapter4.html_myt38>>38. FROM THE /Śiva Purāņa, Dharmasaṃhitā/
:PROPERTIES:
:CLASS: calibre16
:END:
Once in the past, when all the universe moving and still had been
destroyed and had become a single ocean, Brahmā, Viṣņu, and Rudra arose
from the water. Their arrival was unwitnessed, and even wise men do not
know it. The earth, which had been the domain of former beings, had been
destroyed with its creatures moving and still, for a piercing wind had
arisen and dried up the seven oceans, and when all the waters were dried
up everywhere, all creatures moving and still were destroyed, dried up
gradually in succession. A single sun appeared, rising in the east, and
then a second in the south, just like the first, drying up the water on
all sides with its rays and burning all that moved and was still. Then
in the west a third sun arose, and in the north there arose a fourth,
burning all that moved or was still; and later on eight more arose, and
then there were twelve.

The one who is known here as Rudra, the Fire of Doomsday, arose from the
subterranean hell and filled all the regions of the sky. The exalted
one, as he is known everywhere, burnt all of the underworld above and
sideways, without exception, and then he went to his own dwelling place
which he had made
before.^{<<chapter4.html_ipg138_fn31>>[[#page_138.html#pg138_fn31][31]]}
Then clouds arose and rained in all directions, flooding the whole earth
and all the regions of the sky with waters; afterwards, they plunged
into the single ocean which the universe had become. There was no earth,
nor any <<chapter4.html_page_139>>regions of the sky, no space, no
heaven; everything was like a giant cask filled to the brim.

Then the three eternal gods arose from the midst of the water -- Brahmā,
Viṣņu, and Rudra, whose arrivals are unwitnessed. The two --
Ka^{<<chapter4.html_ipg139_fn32>>[[#page_139.html#pg139_fn32][32]]} and
Viṣņu -- bowed and said to Śarva, who blazed with sharp energy and
embraced the
/śakti/^{<<chapter4.html_ipg139_fn33>>[[#page_139.html#pg139_fn33][33]]}
of Rudra, ‘You are the lord of everything, our lord. Perform creation as
you wish.' ‘I will perform it,' he said to them, and then he plunged
into the waters and remained immersed for a thousand celestial years.
Then they said to one another, ‘What will we do without him? How will
creation take place?' Hari said to the Creator, ‘Do as I tell you,
Grandfather: let no more time elapse, but make an effort to create
progeny. For you are capable of creating various creatures in the
worlds; I will give you your own /śakti/, so that you will be the
creator.' Thus encouraged by the words that Viṣņu had spoken to him, he
thought about creating, and then he created everything conducive to
happiness -- gods, demons, Gandharvas, Yakṣas, serpents, Rākṣasas.
When that creation had been performed, Śambhu emerged from the water,
desirous of creating and thinking about it in his mind. But when he saw
the whole universe stretching above and below with the gods, demons,
Gandharvas, Yakṣas, serpents, Rākṣasas and men, the great god's heart
was filled with anger, and he thought, ‘What shall I do? Since creation
has been performed be Brahmā, I will therefore destroy, cutting
off^{<<chapter4.html_ipg139_fn34>>[[#page_139.html#pg139_fn34][34]]} my
own seed.' When he had said this, he released from his mouth a flame
which burnt everything.

<<chapter4.html_page_140>>When Brahmā saw that everything was on fire,
he bowed to the great lord with devotion and praised the lord...
Śaṅkara was pleased by Brahmā's praise, and he told him, ‘I am
Śaṅkara. I will always accomplish everything that is to be done for
anyone who seeks refuge with me, devotedly. I am pleased with you; tell
me what wish you desire in your heart.' When Brahmā heard this he said,
‘I created an extensive range of progeny; let that be as it was, O lord,
if you are pleased with me.' When Rudra heard this he said to Ka, ‘That
energy which I gathered in excess in order to destroy your creation --
tell me, what shall I do with it for you?' Brahmā thought carefully for
the sake of the world, and then he said to Śaṅkara, ‘Cause your own
energy to enter the sun, since you are lord over the sun; for you are
the creator, protector, and destroyer. Let us live together with all the
immortals in the energy of the sun, and we will receive with devotion
the sacred image of the three
times^{<<chapter4.html_ipg140_fn35>>[[#page_140.html#pg140_fn35][35]]}
that was given by mankind. Then, great god, at the end of the aeon you
will take the form of the sun and burn this universe, moving and still,
at that moment.'

He agreed to this and laughed, for he was secretly amused, and he said
to Brahmā, ‘There is no good use for this /liṅga/ except for the
creation of progeny.' And as he said this he broke it off and threw it
upon the surface of the earth. The /liṅga/ broke through the
earth^{<<chapter4.html_ipg140_fn36>>[[#page_140.html#pg140_fn36][36]]}
and went to the very sky. Viṣņu sought the end of it below, and Brahmā
flew
upwards,^{<<chapter4.html_ipg140_fn37>>[[#page_140.html#pg140_fn37][37]]}
but they did not find the end of it, for all their vital effort. Then a
voice arose out of the sky as the two of them sat there, and it said,
‘If the /liṅga/ of the god with braided hair is worshipped,
<<chapter4.html_page_141>>it will certainly grant all desires that are
longed for in the heart.' When Brahmā and Viṣņu heard this, they and
all the divinities worshipped the /liṅga/ with devotion, with their
hearts set upon Rudra.

*THE PINE FOREST SAGES CASTRATE ŚIVA*

The sages of the Pine Forest are the sons of Brahmā and are directly
responsible for the castration of Śiva even as Brahmā is indirectly
responsible; but they are sometimes particularly designated as the Seven
Sages, whose wives are seduced by
Agni-Śiva.^{<<chapter4.html_ipg141_fn38>>[[#page_141.html#pg141_fn38][38]]}
A third, later level of the myth appears in texts which state that the
sages are heretics whom Śiva enlightens. Even in the present text, which
is most closely related to the myth of Agni and the sages' wives, their
‘opinion about /dharma'/ wavers, and Śiva teaches the sages a lesson, a
balance between their violent asceticism and their involvement in
‘worldly ways', the balance of the system of four classes and stages of
life. Finally, this is a myth of revelation and epiphany, for the sages
fail to recognize Śiva and accuse him falsely (even as they accused
their wives, the Kṛttikās, falsely) until they are taught to see him
truly and to worship him as the /liṅga./

**** <<chapter4.html_myt39>>39. FROM THE /Brahmāņḍa Purāņa/
:PROPERTIES:
:CLASS: calibre16
:END:
The sages said: ‘Bard of great intellect, tell us more about the noble
great god; we are eager to hear of his greatness. How did he enter the
Pine Forest in which the bands of divine sages lived, changing his guise
so that the intelligent great sages, who knew the great god, were
deceived and bereft of their wits? And how did they propitiate him to
obtain his favour, when Bhava was not pleased with them? Tell us all of
this as it really was enacted by the god of gods; for you are the
foremost of intellectuals.' The bard replied, ‘Listen carefully and I
will tell you how the god of gods fashioned this /dharma/ out of pity
for those who were devoted to him.'

<<chapter4.html_page_142>>Formerly, in the Kṛta Age, priests lived on
an auspicious peak of Himālaya in a delightful pine forest full of
various trees and vines. Many sages were practising asceticism there,
having taken the vows of sages: some ate nothing but moss; some lay down
immersed in water; some had clouds as their only shelter; others stood
on the tip of the big toe; some used their teeth for mortars; others
broke things on stones. Some sat in yogic posture on their hams; others
took pleasure in living like wild animals. Thus these men of great minds
spent some time in their keen asceticism.

Then the god came to that forest in order to show his grace to them. His
body was pale with the ashes smeared on it; he was naked, and all his
identifying marks were defaced; his hair was disordered and loose; he
had enormous pointed teeth; his hands were busy with fire-brands, and
his eyes were red and tawny. His penis and testicles were like red
chalk, the tip ornamented with red and white chalk. Sometimes he laughed
horribly; sometimes he sang, smiling; sometimes he danced erotically;
sometimes he yelled again and again. As he was dancing, their wives
became bewitched immediately and stood in his way as he came into the
hermitage and begged for alms over and over again. His wife took a
similar form, adorned with ornaments made of grass. He roared like a
bull and bellowed like an ass. As he thus began to deceive all the
embodied creatures there, laughing at them, the sages became angry and
were sullied by anger.

Bewitched by his magic power of delusion, they all tried to curse him:
‘Since you sing like an ass, therefore you will be an ass', or ‘a
Rākṣasa' or ‘a Piśāca' or ‘a demon' or whatever else. All the angry
sages together cursed him with their various curses as each one wished,
and they hurled all their ascetic powers at Śaṅkara, the god who is the
lord of the universe. But just as the stars in the firmament do not
shine when the sun shines, so their energies did not have any effect
<<chapter4.html_page_143>>on Śaṅkara. It has been heard that the
enriched sacrifice of the noble Brahmā, the source of all good things,
was destroyed by a sage's curse; and Viṣņu, of supreme heroic power,
became incarnate ten times, always to be made miserable, because of the
curse of Bhṛgu; and formerly the angry sage Gautama caused the penis
and testicles of Indra to fall to the
ground.^{<<chapter4.html_ipg143_fn39>>[[#page_143.html#pg143_fn39][39]]}
The Vasus were made to dwell as embryos in the womb because of a curse,
and Nahuṣa became a serpent because of the curse of a sage. Brahmins
made the ocean of milk undrinkable, and Dharma himself was cursed by the
noble
Māņḍavya.^{<<chapter4.html_ipg143_fn40>>[[#page_143.html#pg143_fn40][40]]}
These and many others suffered thus from retaliatory curses, all except
for the three-eyed god of gods, the great lord.

But since they were deluded by Śaṅkara so that they did not recognize
him, all the sages said to one another, ‘This is not the behaviour of
householders like us, nor is it the conduct of those who delight in
chastity, nor of those who live in the forest; nor is this the /dharma/
of
ascetics.^{<<chapter4.html_ipg143_fn41>>[[#page_143.html#pg143_fn41][41]]}
It has never been seen anywhere. This most evil conduct has deluded this
man.' Then they said to him, ‘Cause your /liṅga/ to fall off. This is
not the /dharma/ of ascetics. Speak with honeyed words and put on a
single
garment,^{<<chapter4.html_ipg143_fn42>>[[#page_143.html#pg143_fn42][42]]}
and when your /liṅga/ has been abandoned you will then be worshipped.'
Then the lord Śaṅkara, the Destroyer of the Eyes of Bhaga, spoke to the
sages with smooth words, seeming to smile, saying, ‘Brahmā and all the
other gods cannot make our /liṅga/ fall off by force, let alone others
who are rich in ascetic powers, but I will cause this
<<chapter4.html_page_144>>/liṅga/ to fall off, O best of twice-born
ones.'^{<<chapter4.html_ipg144_fn43>>[[#page_144.html#pg144_fn43][43]]}
‘Stay in the hermitage or go,' they said to him, and when the great god
was thus addressed all his senses and emotions were delighted, and, as
they all watched, the lord vanished.

When the lord had vanished and the /liṅga/ was cut off, there was no
manifestation of the deity among all the beings in the triple world, and
there was confusion everywhere. Nothing shone forth; the sun gave no
heat, purifying fire had no lustre, and the constellations and planets
were all topsyturvy. The seasons did not come about for the sages of
mighty souls who had become involved in worldly ways for the sake of
offspring and who went to their wives during the fertile
season.^{<<chapter4.html_ipg144_fn44>>[[#page_144.html#pg144_fn44][44]]}
They continued to practise /dharma/, free from egoism, free from
possessiveness, but their virile powers were destroyed, and their energy
was destroyed. Then their opinion about /dharma/ wavered, and they all
went together to the world of Brahmā; they went to the house of Brahmā
and saw the lotus-born god, and they all fell at his feet and told him
what Śiva had done:

‘A hideous person -- one with enormous pointed teeth, his hair standing
on end, his hands busy with fire-brands, his eyes red and tawny, his
penis and testicles adorned with red chalk -- moved about amongst our
daughters-in-law and daughters, and especially our young daughters,
lusting for the
“reversal”.^{<<chapter4.html_ipg144_fn45>>[[#page_144.html#pg144_fn45][45]]}
We thought, “He is mad!” and so we treated him
<<chapter4.html_page_145>>with contempt; we abused him and beat him and
tore out his /liṅga./ Now we have come to you for refuge, in order to
allay his anger, for we do not know how to do this; tell us,
Grandfather.'

When Brahmā heard the speech of the sages, he realized by meditation
that it had been the Lord. Then he replied to them, very calmly, ‘You
should have recognized that god as the great lord, the great god Śiva.
His highest place cannot be comprehended even by gods and sages and
ancestors, for he is the lord. During the dissolution at the end of a
thousand aeons, the blessed great lord destroys all embodied creatures,
for then he becomes Doomsday. He alone creates all creatures by his own
energy; he is the bearer of the discus, whose chest is marked by the
Śrivatsa
sign.^{<<chapter4.html_ipg145_fn46>>[[#page_145.html#pg145_fn46][46]]}
In the Kṛta Age he is the yogi; in the Tretā Age he is known as Kratu;
in the Dvāpara Age he is the Doomsday Fire, and in the Kali Age he is
Dharmaketu.^{<<chapter4.html_ipg145_fn47>>[[#page_145.html#pg145_fn47][47]]}
Three forms of Rudra are recognized by learned men: his dark form is
Agni, his passionate form Brahmā, and the form of goodness is known as
Viṣņu.^{<<chapter4.html_ipg145_fn48>>[[#page_145.html#pg145_fn48][48]]}
Digvāsas,^{<<chapter4.html_ipg145_fn49>>[[#page_145.html#pg145_fn49][49]]}
one of his forms, is known by the name of Śiva, and that form is full of
the yoga of Brahmā. Therefore you should propitiate the god, the god of
gods, the lord, the undying lord; and you must conquer your anger and
your senses, O best of priests. You <<chapter4.html_page_146>>should
make an image of the /liṅga/ of the noble one as you saw it, and go to
the god who has the trident in his hand. Then you will see the lord of
gods who cannot be seen by those who have not mastered their selves, and
when you have seen him all your ignorance and /adharma/ will be
destroyed.' They reverently walked
around^{<<chapter4.html_ipg146_fn50>>[[#page_146.html#pg146_fn50][50]]}
Brahmā, whose vitality is immeasurable, and they stayed in the Pine
Forest, for their sorrow had been removed. They began to propitiate Śiva
as Brahmā had instructed, on altars measured out on the ground, and on
undulating hills, and in caves, and on the sparkling, brilliant
sand-banks of rivers, for a full year, until spring came again.

Then the god took the same form and came to the forest. The great lord
entered that forest hermitage that was full of flowers and many trees
and creepers, with swarms of bees humming around the sweet sap, and full
of the lovely sound of cuckoos. All the sages praised him calmly, and
with offerings of water and garlands of many kinds of flowers and
incense and perfume the illustrious ones with their wives and sons and
servants worshipped him. Then with gentle words they said to the lord of
the mountain, ‘Forgive all that we did in our ignorance of the god of
gods, in act or mind or speech...' Then the lord god said, ‘Those who
delight in my ashes have their sins burnt away by ashes; they are
self-controlled priests intent upon meditation, who act as they speak. A
wise man will not censure them nor transgress against them, nor will he
speak unpleasant things to them if he wishes to prosper here. Whatever
fool blames them, he blames the great god; and whoever worships them, he
constantly worships Śaṅkara. Behave in this way, if you please, and you
will obtain fulfilment from me.'

When they learned from Śiva this supreme ritual that
<<chapter4.html_page_147>>destroys great darkness and is without equal
on earth, they all fell on the ground, touching it with their heads, for
their fear and greed and delusion and worries had been removed. Then the
priests rejoiced and they bathed the
image^{<<chapter4.html_ipg147_fn51>>[[#page_147.html#pg147_fn51][51]]}
of the great lord with pure perfumed waters mixed with /kuśa/ grass and
flowers, and they bathed the great lord, the god, with great pots of
water, and they sang various sweet-sounding secret spells... When the
/liṅga/ had been established again for the welfare of the worlds, those
excellent sages became intent upon the
/dharma/^{<<chapter4.html_ipg147_fn52>>[[#page_147.html#pg147_fn52][52]]}
of the classes.

Then the great lord was pleased, and he said to the sages, ‘I am pleased
with your asceticism. You have kept your vows well. Choose a boon.' All
the sages then prostrated themselves before the great lord -- Bhṛgu,
Aṅgiras, Vasiṣṭha, Viśvāmitra, Gautama, Atri, Sukeśa, Pulastya,
Pulaha, Kratu, Marīci, Kaśyapa, and Saṃvarta of great ascetic power.
They all bowed to the great god and said, ‘The bathing with ashes,
nakedness, and “left-handedness” that goes against the
grain,^{<<chapter4.html_ipg147_fn53>>[[#page_147.html#pg147_fn53][53]]}
and that which is to be used or not to be used -- lord, we wish to know
that.' The lord replied, ‘I will proclaim this entire matter to you this
very day. I am Agni joined with Soma, and I am Soma mingled with Agni.
They say that Agni is “done and not
done”,^{<<chapter4.html_ipg147_fn54>>[[#page_147.html#pg147_fn54][54]]}
and yet people have often sought refuge with Agni; again and again the
universe, moving and still, is burnt by Agni. The supreme purification
of this entire universe is to be accomplished by ashes; I place my seed
in ashes and sprinkle creatures with it. One who has done that which is
to be done by fire will master the three
<<chapter4.html_page_148>>times. By means of ashes, my seed, one is
released from all sins. When ashes illuminate anything brightly and make
it fragrant, from that moment it is called “ash” and ashes alone remain
from all evils. The ancestors are known as drinkers of
steam,^{<<chapter4.html_ipg148_fn55>>[[#page_148.html#pg148_fn55][55]]}
and the gods are born of Soma; for all this universe, moving and still,
has Agni and Soma for its soul. I am Agni of great energy, and this
woman, my wife Ambikā, is Soma; and I am both Agni and Soma, as I am
myself the Man together with
Nature.^{<<chapter4.html_ipg148_fn56>>[[#page_148.html#pg148_fn56][56]]}
Therefore, illustrious ones, ashes are known as my seed, and I bear my
own seed upon my body as is my custom. Henceforth, ashes will be used
for protection against inauspicious people, and in the houses where
women give birth. And one who has purified his soul by bathing in ashes,
conquered his anger, and subdued his senses will come into my presence
and never be reborn again. The vow of the lord of cattle, and the yoga
of the
skull^{<<chapter4.html_ipg148_fn57>>[[#page_148.html#pg148_fn57][57]]}
-- this vow performed by this yoga is the supreme vow, for it was made
first and all the other orders were created afterwards by the
self-created one. This creation was created by me and has shame,
delusion, and fear as its soul; for the gods and sages are born naked,
and all the other men in the world are born without clothing. People
with unconquered senses are naked even if they are clothed in silk, for
if one is enveloped in unconquered senses no garment can hide him.
Patience, forbearance, non-injury, passionlessness, indifference to
honour or dishonour -- this is one's best garment. Let a man smear his
body until it is pale with ashes and meditate upon Bhava in
<<chapter4.html_page_149>>his heart, and then even if he does a thousand
things that one ought not to do, by bathing in ashes he will cause all
of that to be burnt to ashes as fire burns a forest with its energy.
Therefore if anyone makes a great effort always, even throughout the
three times, to bathe with ashes, then he becomes a leader of my hosts,
receives all sacrifices, and grasps the supreme ambrosia.'

*THE VAIṢŅAVA VERSION: BHŖGU CURSES ŚIVA TO BE WORSHIPPED AS A
/liṅga/*

In the pro-Śaiva versions of the Pine Forest myth, even where it is not
clear whether Śiva's /liṅga/ falls because of the sages' curse or as
part of Śiva's plan, he establishes /liṅga/-worship himself, for the
benefit of the sages and to magnify himself. In Vaiṣņava versions of
the myth, however, the /liṅga/-worship itself is a curse inflicted upon
Śiva by Bhṛgu, the leader of the Pine Forest sages. This myth is the
mirror image of the myth of Dakṣa: both begin with a great sacrificial
gathering, but here Śiva becomes deprived of a share of the sacrifice,
reduced back from orthodoxy to heterodoxy once more. Śiva and Brahmā
receive the same curses which Anasūyā inflicts upon them
elsewhere,^{<<chapter4.html_ipg149_fn58>>[[#page_149.html#pg149_fn58][58]]}
but Viṣņu is now the supreme god, and he alone here escapes unscathed,
for he allows the brahmin to treat him as contemptuously as the Pine
Forest brahmins tried in vain to treat Śiva.

**** <<chapter4.html_myt40>>40. FROM THE /Padma Purāņa/
:PROPERTIES:
:CLASS: calibre16
:END:
Once, in the past, Manu the son of the Self-created
Prajāpati^{<<chapter4.html_ipg149_fn59>>[[#page_149.html#pg149_fn59][59]]}
went to a special, lengthy sacrifice on the highest mountain Mandara,
with all the pre-eminent sages of painful vows, sages who knew the
various sacred books and had the lustre of the fire of the sun at dawn,
brahmins who knew all the Vedas and were devoted to all /dharmas/, whose
sins had been worn away. When the great sacrifice was taking place, the
<<chapter4.html_page_150>>sages rich in asceticism said to one another,
in order to find out the true nature of the divinities, ‘Who is the best
of the divinities, worthy of being worshipped by brahmins who know the
Vedas? Who, among Brahmā, Viṣņu, and the Great Lord, should be praised
as the one who gives release to men? The water left from washing his
feet is to be sought; the leavings from his food are purifying; his
favour would be a shrine to delight the spirits of the departed
ancestors, for he is the undying, the highest abode, the eternal,
supreme self.'

A great discussion arose among them as they sat together. Some of the
great sages said, ‘Rudra is the One'; other eminent sages said, ‘Brahmā
is to be worshipped.' Other worshippers said, ‘The sun should be
worshipped by all souls.' And some of the twice-born said, ‘The blessed
husband of Śrī, the highest Man, who is in everything, undying, whose
eyes are like pale lotuses, the son of Vasudeva, beyond the beyond,
without birth or death, Viṣņu is the highest lord, the best of
divinities, the one to be worshipped.' As they were disputing, Manu the
son of the self-created one said, ‘He who is made of pure
goodness,^{<<chapter4.html_ipg150_fn60>>[[#page_150.html#pg150_fn60][60]]}
the lord endowed with the auspicious quality, with eyes like pale
lotuses, the blessed lord of Śrī, the highest Man, he alone is the lord
worshipped by brahmins who know the Vedas. The others should not be
worshipped by brahmins, for they are tainted with passion and darkness.'

When all the great sages heard his speech, they folded their palms and
said to the brahmin Bhṛgu, who was rich in ascetic power, ‘You are able
to dispel our doubt, for you have kept <<chapter4.html_page_151>>your
vow well. Go to Brahmā, Viṣņu, and the great lord Śiva, and observe
their forms to find out in which one the quality of goodness is pure.
That one is to be worshipped by brahmins, but never the others; the
left-overs from his food are very purifying for gods and ancestors.
Therefore, best of sages, go to the dwelling-places of the gods; act
quickly for the welfare of all people, O lord.'

When that supreme sage heard this he went quickly on the path of the
wind to Kailāsa, to the god whose banner bears a bull. The twice-born
one went up to the door of the house of the noble Śaṅkara and said to
the fierce Nandin, who held a trident in his hand, ‘I am the brahmin
Bhṛgu, and I have come to see Hara, the supreme god. Announce me
quickly to the noble Śaṅkara.' When Nandin, the lord of all Śiva's
hosts, heard his speech, he replied rudely to the great sage whose
vitality was immeasurable: ‘No one can enter the presence of the lord
now, for Śaṅkara is making love to the goddess. Turn back, turn back,
sage, if you wish to live.' When Nandin had thus turned him away, the
great ascetic remained there for many days at the door of Śaṅkara's
house. Then Bhṛgu was filled with anger, and the sage pronounced a
curse: ‘Śaṅkara, the fool, is immersed in darkness and does not
recognize me. Since he is so intoxicated by union with a woman that he
dishonours me, therefore he will have the form of the
/yoni/^{<<chapter4.html_ipg151_fn61>>[[#page_151.html#pg151_fn61][61]]}
and the /liṅga./ He shows contempt for me, a brahmin, for he is
overcome by darkness. Since he has be-haved in a way unbefitting a
brahmin, he is not to be worshipped by the twice-born. Therefore the
food, water, flowers, and oblations given to him will all be what is
left from offerings to other gods.'

When the sage of great energy had thus cursed Śaṅkara who is worshipped
by all people, he said to the servant Nandin,
<<chapter4.html_page_152>>who was very cruel and held a trident in his
hand, ‘Those who are devoted to Rudra in the world, who carry the
/liṅga/ and wear ashes and bones, they will be heretics beyond the pale
of the Vedas.' When Rudra, the Destroyer of the Triple City, heard his
speech, he set out to slay Bhṛgu, taking his trident in his hand, for
he was immersed in total darkness. But Pārvatī, who had a sense of
decorum, restrained the great god, folding her palms together and
prostrating herself before him. As Śiva stood there, restrained by
Gaurī, Bhṛgu of great energy saw the forehead eye blazing like the fire
of ten million suns. But the sage, pointing out that Śiva's eye was
looking at his own two feet, laughed and went away, saying, ‘My curse is
never in vain. You are certainly hideously deformed.' And thenceforth
the water that has washed the feet of the Lord of Ghosts is not to be
touched by priests, and Śiva in the form of the /liṅga/ is to be
worshipped only by heretics.

After the sage had thus cursed Rudra, the Destroyer of the Triple City,
he went to the world of Brahmā, which is honoured by all people. There
the great sage saw Brahmā, the supreme lord, seated with the gods, and
the great ascetic folded his palms and bowed to the god and stood in
silence before him. When the creator saw that the great sage, the tiger
among sages, had arrived, he did not welcome him, for he was immersed in
passion; the creator did not rise or make a pleasant speech to him, but
he remained there majestically on his lotus seat. When the great sage of
great energy saw him sitting on his lotus, full of passion, he spoke
thus to the Grandfather of the world: ‘Since you who abound in great
passion have dishonoured me, therefore you will not be worshipped by
anyone.'

When he had thus cursed the noble Brahmā, who had been worshipped by all
people, the brahmin Bhṛgu went quickly to the palace of the lord
Viṣņu. And thereafter the Grandfather was not worshipped by gods, men,
Rākṣasas or supreme <<chapter4.html_page_153>>sages. As Bhṛgu entered
the world of Viṣņu on the northern shore of the ocean of milk, he was
worshipped as he deserved by the generous ones who dwelt there.
Unhindered, the twice-born one entered the inner harem in the spotless
palace that shone like the sun. There he saw Viṣņu, the lord of the
lotus goddess Laksmī, lying on his serpent
couch^{<<chapter4.html_ipg153_fn62>>[[#page_153.html#pg153_fn62][62]]}
with his two feet being massaged by the lotus hands of Laksmī. When
Bhṛgu, the tiger among sages, saw him he was filled with anger, and he
stamped with his left foot upon the glorious breast of Viṣņu. The lord
arose quickly and said joyfully, ‘I am grateful to you,' and he rejoiced
and pressed the sage's foot with his two hands and rubbed his foot
gently and spoke these honeyed words: ‘I am fortunate today, O brahmin
sage; I am fulfilled in every way, for the touch of your foot upon my
body will be a blessing. May I be purified by the particles of dust from
a brahmin's feet, particles which cause one to obtain all good fortune,
fires to burn away whatever misfortunes may arise, bridges over the
shoreless ocean of rebirth. Whenever the dust from a brahmin's feet
touches one's body, all the shrines of the Ganges and the other rivers
surely remain in him forever.'

When Viṣņu, who excites men, had said this, he arose quickly with the
goddess and welcomed him with devotion, with celestial garlands,
sandalwood paste, and so forth. When the tiger among sages saw him, his
eyes filled with tears of joy; he stood up from his fine seat and bowed
to the Treasury of Compassion. Folding his palms together, the great
ascetic spoke to him joyfully... Bhṛgu then bowed to the god again and
again. The great and noble celestial sages honoured Bhṛgu to his soul's
delight, and he went back to the place where the sages were gathered at
the sacrifice. The great sages arose and bowed to the noble Bhṛgu and
offered him worship in various ways. Then the bull among sages reported
everything to them:

<<chapter4.html_page_154>>‘The creator and the lord, Brahmā and Śiva,
the two supreme gods, abound in the qualities of passion and darkness. I
cursed them, and they are not to be worshipped by priests, O best of
sages. Śaṅkara, who is enveloped in darkness on a peak of Kailāsa,
acted in a way unbefitting a brahmin, and so he has assumed a despicable
form. But Viṣņu is made of pure goodness, an ocean of the auspicious
quality; Nārāyaņa is the highest godhead; Hari is the divinity for
brahmins. Viṣņu, the husband of Śri, the son of Vasudeva, the Exciter
of Men, whose eyes are like pale lotuses, Govinda, the unfallen Hari
acts as befits a brahmin. He alone, but no other bull among men, is to
be worshipped by priests. Anyone so deluded that he worships another god
will become a heretic, but by merely thinking of Kṛṣņa sinners obtain
release.'

*ŚIVA DESTROYS KĀMA AND REVIVES HIM*

As the great ascetic, Śiva is opposed to Kāma, the god of desire; but as
the god of the /liṅga/, Śiva competes with and ‘overreaches' Kāma. The
complex cycle of Śiva-Kāma myths begins, like so many myths, with a boon
foolishly granted by Brahmā to a powerful demon.

**** 41. FROM THE /Saura Purāņa/
:PROPERTIES:
:CLASS: calibre16
:END:
The demon Tāraka was born in the family of demons; he was a thorn in the
world, a hero who was the very form of death for those who dwell in
heaven. He propitiated Brahmā by means of his asceticism and obtained a
boon from him; then Tāraka put the gods to flight, for he was more
powerful than they, and he forcibly carried off the wives of the gods.
Śakra and the other gods, so famous for their vitality, were heated by
the fire of misery, and they sought refuge with Brahmā, the lord of the
thirty-three gods. When the lotus-born god <<chapter4.html_page_155>>saw
that the gods had arrived, he said, ‘What are you frightened of, gods,
to make you come here to me? Tell me all about it, and I will find a
means of helping you.' The gods replied, ‘Because we are as terrified of
Tāraka as we are terrified of death, we have come to seek refuge with
the god; therefore you should protect us, for we cannot find contentment
even for a moment, O god, best of gods. For thirty thousand years, day
and night, without respite, there has been a fierce battle between Hari
and Tāraka, but the god of gods, armed with his discus, has not
conquered Tāraka. Knowing that he cannot be killed, the mighty Viṣņu,
armed with his bow, has abandoned the fight and gone quickly to the
great ocean, confused and worried. Therefore we are frightened and have
come to you for refuge, lord; protect us; grant us comfort, lotus-born
one.'

Brahmā said, ‘Listen to my words, which will bring you all great
comfort, immortals. This proud Tāraka practised supreme asceticism, and
when I saw that the universe moving and still was being burnt by the
ascetic heat of that demon, I went to Tāraka to grant him a boon. “My
child,” I said, “choose a boon,” and the great demon, king of the
demons, folded his palms and bowed to me and said, “Lotus-born one,
grant me the boon that I may not be slain by any of the gods, Viṣņu and
the others.” I granted him that boon, but then I added, for the sake of
your welfare, supreme gods, “Tell me, by whom may you be slain?” Tāraka
answered, “My death will come from one born when the gods, including
Viṣņu, become pregnant by drinking the seed of the god above all gods,
the god with braided hair, the blue and red one; but not otherwise.” I
agreed to this and went to the top of Meru. Therefore seek refuge with
him who is a refuge to all embodied creatures, the lord of all, the
lover of Umā, Śaṅkara who gives peace to all people. Except for Hara, I
see no god in the triple world, moving and still, who could kill Tāraka,
O gods.'

<<chapter4.html_page_156>>When he heard the speech of Brahmā, the
thousand-eyed lord of ŚacŚ wondered how this could come about, and the
king of the gods, together with the divinities and their guru,
determined to think of a way to bring about the birth of a son of Hara.
Then the gods went with Śakra and Brahmā to a peak on the tip of Meru
where
Mādhava^{<<chapter4.html_ipg156_fn63>>[[#page_156.html#pg156_fn63][63]]}
was hiding, for though his soul was immeasurable he was tortured by fear
of Tāraka. When Mādhava saw the gods and Brahmā he was delighted, and he
said, ‘What means has been devised for the slaughter of Tāraka? If there
is any, tell me, gods, so that we may have shelter and comfort.' When
they heard the speech of Viṣņu, Brahmā and the rest of the supreme gods
told Viṣņu what Brahmā had told them. Then the king of the gods
considered what was to be done now, and he remembered Kāma, who could
not be conquered by gods or demons. When Kāma, the husband of Rati, knew
that Śakra had thought of him, he took up his flower-bow, went to the
husband of Śacī, and said, ‘What duty is there for me to perform, O best
of the thirty-three gods? Who threatens your position with his keen
asceticism? Or what woman does not wish to obey your command? I will
make her full of desire, intent upon thoughts of you, this very day.
There is no hero, no proud woman, no learned man too powerful for me. I
pervade the whole universe, moving and still, beginning with Brahmā the
Creator. But what need is there to say more? Even the great sage
Durvāsas^{<<chapter4.html_ipg156_fn64>>[[#page_156.html#pg156_fn64][64]]}
would fall quickly when pierced by my arrows, O lord of the Maruts.'

‘Lord of Rati,' said Indra, ‘I know what you are capable of with your
flower-bow. All things that are to be done are accomplished by you, and
not otherwise. Go to the great lord Śiva, if you wish to do what is for
the welfare of the gods; <<chapter4.html_page_157>>shake the mind of
Hara and make him unite with Pārvatī. This is what must be done for me;
this is my wish. For this reason I thought of you who bear the
flower-bow.' When he heard what Śakra had said, the powerful god who is
born in the heart, who has the crocodile on his banner, the god with
five arrows, went with Rati and his friend Spring to the place where the
lord Śambhu, the great lord, was concentrating with the gaze of trance,
motionless, meditating upon the self within himself.

As he reached the abode of Śambhu, the god who has the crocodile on his
banner saw
Śailādi^{<<chapter4.html_ipg157_fn65>>[[#page_157.html#pg157_fn65][65]]}
at the door, standing as high as a peak of Meru, adorned with all
ornaments, glowing like a thousand suns, holding a trident in his hand,
three-eyed, adorned with a sliver of the moon, a thunderbolt in his
hand, four-armed, like a second Śaṅkara. When
Madana^{<<chapter4.html_ipg157_fn66>>[[#page_157.html#pg157_fn66][66]]}
saw him, he was filled with anxiety: ‘How shall I be able to enter and
wax strong inside Śambhu who is venerated by the thirty-three gods? How
will I do what must be done to increase the pleasure of the gods?' As he
was thinking of various ways to deceive Nandin, he took the form of a
fragrant breeze, gentle and cool. Then Kāma entered from the southern
direction; and for this reason, even today the breeze from the region of
Yama, the south, is pleasant, fragrant, gentle and cool.

There Madana saw the lord, like ten million suns, with a thousand eyes
and a thousand bodies, the tall god with a blue neck, shining like
ambrosia, adorned with a shining crescent moon, shining like pure
crystal, like a smokeless fire, the god whose favour is the cause of the
birth, destruction, and maintenance of the universe... When the god who
bears the crocodile on his banner saw the great god, he rejoiced and
<<chapter4.html_page_158>>stretched his bow and stood ready, watching
the god who is the source of all existence; thus Kāma, who is born in
the mind, stood for sixty million years. Then the lord god Śaṅkara,
Śiva, the lord of all, who puts an end to the god of the flower-arrows,
opened his two eyes and saw the goddess, the daughter of the mountain,
shyly engaged in asceticism before him. A suspicion arose within him as
he saw her, and he wondered, ‘What is going on here?' Then Śarva
decided, ‘Kāma is here,' and when he realized this he looked about and
saw him with his bow drawn, and Madana was burnt by the fire from his
eye.

When the husband of Rati had been burnt, Śambhu said to the daughter of
the mountain, ‘What can I do for you, empress of the gods? What is in
your heart? Tell me what boon you wish, great goddess, empress of the
gods, and I will grant it today. Mistress of the gods, what is there
that you cannot obtain when I am pleased?' ‘Blue-necked god,' answered
Pārvatī, ‘now that Kāma has been killed, what can I do with a boon from
you today? For without Kāma there can be between a man and a woman no
emotion which is like ten million suns. When emotion is destroyed, how
could happiness be attained? Tell me, you who are to be honoured by the
lord of gods.'

Then he who had put an end to Madana replied, ‘Lady with beautiful eyes,
I did not burn Madana, but this very form of my eye which has fire as
its essence burnt him by itself. Now tell me, what can I do?' ‘Bhava,
lord of ghosts,' said the goddess, ‘you who are not to be blamed or
excluded, why are you embarrassed when you think, “This is a girl!”
Since you are under no one's control, then burn me too as I stand before
you. You are the god Hara, Śiva, ruler of all the gods, Brahmā and the
others. If you are determined to carry out a deception, who is capable
of preventing you? But you should not deceive me, O lord god, for I have
come to you for refuge, and <<chapter4.html_page_159>>I have no one else
to go to for shelter, and so you should protect me. You are the eye of
the universe; you are the lord of worlds. You create the universe and
put it in order; you face in all directions...'

Then Hara, the Destroyer of the Triple City, was propitiated, and he
said to the goddess
Kāli,^{<<chapter4.html_ipg159_fn67>>[[#page_159.html#pg159_fn67][67]]}
‘Choose a boon and I will grant it, goddess, for you have kept your vow
well.' ‘Great god,' replied the goddess, ‘let Kāma live and heat the
world. My lord, without Kāma I do not request anything at all.' The lord
answered, ‘Let Madana be without a body in order to please you, lady
with beautiful eyes. In that form he will be able to shake the world.'
And because of what Hara said when Umā urged him, the god with the
crocodile banner arose in a disembodied form, impossible to delimit,
going here and there like the wind with his bow and arrow, accompanied
by Rati. Thus the great lord Hara himself happily gave a boon to
Smara,^{<<chapter4.html_ipg159_fn68>>[[#page_159.html#pg159_fn68][68]]}
the god of five arrows, and then he vanished. Whoever reads this chapter
with devotion, is released from all sins and grows great in the world of
Brahmā, in the presence of the lord.

*ŚIVA ENGENDERS THE SUBMARINE MARE*

In the myth of Śiva, Kāma, Pārvatī and Skanda, the episode of the
submarine mare appears to be superfluous and digressive in terms of
plot; most variants of the Skanda myth omit it entirely, while many
other tales are told to explain the birth of the submarine mare. But the
symbolism of the mare reveals an essential tie with the Skanda myth, for
the fiery mare is placed in a delicate balance deep within the ocean,
where her flames harmlessly devour the waters, holding in
<<chapter4.html_page_160>>check both their floods and her own
destructive flame, until, at doomsday, she is released; like Śiva's seed
in the Ganges, the mare is the immortal fire that -- unlike common
flames -- is unquenched by waters and, on the contrary, burns them.

:END:
When the fire from the third eye of Śambhu had burnt Kāma to ashes, it
blazed forth everywhere fruitlessly. A great cry of woe arose in the
triple world, moving and still, and all the celestial sages ran quickly
for refuge with Brahmā. Deeply upset, they all narrated their misery to
Brahmā, and they folded their palms together and bent their heads and
bowed low to him and praised him. When Brahmā heard this he pondered
over the cause and, remembering Śiva, he went to him humbly in order to
protect the three worlds. The fire which had burnt Kāma shone forth with
a halo of flames, but it was paralysed by Brahmā who had obtained great
energy by the grace of Śambhu. Then Brahmā took that fire of anger which
wished to burn the triple universe, and he put it inside a mare with
ambrosial^{<<chapter4.html_ipg160_fn69>>[[#page_160.html#pg160_fn69][69]]}
flames in her mouth. And then, by the wish of Śiva and for the sake of
the world, Brahmā, the lord of universes, took that fire in the body of
a mare to the ocean. When the ocean saw that Brahmā had come, he assumed
the form of a man, folded his palms, and approached Brahmā. The ocean
bowed low to the Grandfather of all people, praised him as was fitting,
and said with pleasure, ‘Why have you come here, Brahmā, lord of all?
Command me freely, knowing that I am your servant.'

When Brahmā heard the words of the ocean spoken so gladly, he remembered
Śaṅkara and spoke for the benefit of the world, saying, ‘Wise one, you
who bring about the welfare of the whole world, great ocean, listen and
I will gladly <<chapter4.html_page_161>>tell you, for I am urged by
Śiva's wish in my heart. This great power that has become a mare is the
anger of the great lord, which, having burnt Kāma, desire, quickly
became desirous of burning everything. At the wish of Śaṅkara and the
importunity of the suffering gods, who came quickly to me, I paralysed
the fire, gave it the form of a mare, and brought it here to show it to
you, to beg you to show pity, O bearer of waters, lord of rivers. This
anger of the great lord in the form of a mare with flames in her mouth
must be held by you until the final flood, when I will come and dwell
here and you will release this marvellous anger born of Śaṅkara. Your
water will be its constant food, and you must control it with great care
so that it does not reach inside
you.'^{<<chapter4.html_ipg161_fn70>>[[#page_161.html#pg161_fn70][70]]}

The ocean made a firm promise to Brahmā to hold the fierce mare-fire
which could not be held by anyone else. Then the fire with the body of a
mare entered the ocean, shining with its halo of flames, thoroughly
burning the floods of water. Brahmā went home, satisfied in his mind,
and the ocean in its celestial form bowed to Brahma and vanished. All
the universe became safe, freed by Bhava from that danger, and the gods
and sages became content.

*ŚIVA ENGENDERS SKANDA*

In some versions of the myth of the mare, Brahmā seeks in vain the
assistance of several rivers before he finds one that will agree to
carry the fire to the ocean; in the same way, the burning seed of Śiva
is handed on from one agent to another (all of them regarded as the
‘parents' of Skanda) until it finds its final rest in the Ganges -- and
even then it is cast out once more, now in the form of the infant
Skanda, to find its final elixir in the milk from the breasts of the
Goddess.

In the myth of Skanda's birth, the gods and Agni interrupt the love-play
of Śiva and Pārvatī just as Bhṛgu attempts to do and the
<<chapter4.html_page_162>>Pine Forest sages do in many variants of the
myth; this interruption is necessary because, although the gods have
gone to great pains to cause Śiva to marry -- enlisting the aid of Kāma,
begging Śiva to revive Kāma, sending the Seven
Sages^{<<chapter4.html_ipg162_fn71>>[[#page_162.html#pg162_fn71][71]]}
to ask Himālaya for Pārvatī on Śiva's behalf -- nevertheless, when Śiva
does marry, his violent erotic activity causes new problems for the
gods.

:END:
The earth with its serpent and
tortoise^{<<chapter4.html_ipg162_fn72>>[[#page_162.html#pg162_fn72][72]]}
trembled, oppressed by the weight of the excessive amorous play of the
two powerful deities, the god with his /śakti./ Because of the burden of
the tortoise, the very air which supports everything was compressed
solid, and the three worlds were agitated with fear. Then all the gods
went with Brahmā to take refuge in Hari, and, dejected at heart, they
reported everything that had happened: ‘God of gods, husband of Lakṣmī,
lord, saviour of everyone, protect us; we have come to you for refuge,
for our minds are disturbed by fear. The breath of the triple world is
compressed solid, and we do not know the cause; the triple world, moving
and still, with all the sages and gods, is agitated.' Brahmā and all the
gods then stood there before Viṣņu, dejected, silent, and miserable,
and when Hari heard this, he took all the gods quickly to Mount Kailāsa,
the place dear to Śiva.

Hari, who is dear to the gods, came there with the gods and went to
Śiva's favourite place, for he wished to see Śaṅkara. But when Viṣņu
failed to see Śiva there, he and the gods were surprised, and with great
courtesy he asked the hosts of Śiva who were standing there, ‘Servants
of Śaṅkara the lord of all, where has Śiva gone? Be merciful and tell
us kindly, for we are so unhappy.' Then the hosts of Śaṅkara said
kindly to the <<chapter4.html_page_163>>husband of Laksmī, ‘Hari, if you
and Brahmā and the ageless ones listen with love for Śiva, we will tell
you accurately all that has happened. The great lord Śiva, the lord of
all, has gone into the dwelling place of Pārvatī, the daughter of the
mountain, after stationing us here; he is an expert in various forms of
love-play. We do not know what the great lord Śambhu is doing in the
inner apartments of her house, but many years have passed, O husband of
Lakṣmī'

When Viṣṅu and Brahmā and the immortals heard their speech they were
most amazed, and they went to Śiva's door. Hari, who is dear to the
gods, went there with the gods and Brahmā, and he spoke in a shrill,
pained, frenzied voice; with great emotion Hari stood there with Brahmā
and the gods and praised Śiva, Hara, the lord of all people: ‘Great god,
supreme lord, what are you doing inside there? All of us, the gods, have
come to you for refuge, for we are tortured by Tāraka; protect us.' Thus
Hari and Brahmā and the gods who were tortured by Tāraka praised Śambhu
in many ways, and Hari wept copiously. A dismal uproar arose among the
dwellers in heaven who were tortured by the demon, a moan which mingled
with the sound of their praise of Śiva.

When the great god, expert in the knowledge of yoga, heard this, he lost
his desire but still he did not cease his erotic play, for he was afraid
of Pārvatī. Finally, after some time, Śiva came to the door of his house
where the gods awaited, oppressed by the demon, for Śaṅkara is full of
affection toward his devotees. When all the ageless gods saw the lord
Śiva full of affection toward his devotees, they became extremely happy
and bowed down and bent their shoulders and praised Śaṅkara with great
emotion, saying, ‘God of gods, great god, ocean of mercy, lord, you move
within all creatures; Śaṅkara, you know everything. Do what must be
done for the gods, O lord; protect the gods, great lord. Kill the
demons, Tāraka and the others, and have pity on us.'

<<chapter4.html_page_164>>When the lord Bhava heard their words he was
saddened, and he replied with a sorrowful heart, ‘Viṣņu, Brahmā, gods,
my heart is the refuge for all of you. What will be comes to be, and no
one can prevent it; what has been, has been. Now, immortals, listen to
the matter at hand: who will now take my seed, the semen of Śiva, that
has been shed? Let him take it.' And as he said this, he caused it to
fall upon the ground. Then Agni, urged by all the ageless ones, became a
dove and with his beak he ate all the seed of Śambhu.

At this moment the daughter of the mountain came there, when Śiva
delayed in returning, and she saw them who were like bulls among the
gods, and she knew all that had happened. Then
Śivā^{<<chapter4.html_ipg164_fn73>>[[#page_164.html#pg164_fn73][73]]}
was filled with great anger, and she said to Hari and all the other
thirty-three gods, ‘All of you bands of gods are wicked, particularly
eager to accomplish your own ends always, so that you cause great misery
to others. For the sake of your own purposes you gods propitiated the
highest lord, the great lord, and ruined my erotic pleasure, and so I
have become barren. But no one, not even the ageless ones, can be happy
after opposing me, and therefore you wicked ones who dwell in the triple
heaven will become miserable.' When she had said this, Śivā the daughter
of the king of mountains blazed forth with anger and cursed Viṣņu and
all the gods: ‘From today forth, let all the wives of the gods be
barren, and let all the gods who opposed me be miserable.'

Thus having cursed Viṣņu and all the gods, the empress of everything
spoke in fury to the Purifier, who had eaten the seed of Śiva: ‘Fire,
you will be omnivorous, constantly tortured in your soul. You do not
know the true nature of Śiva; you are a fool, doing what the gods need
to have done. You wicked wretch, who obey the foul counsel of the
wicked, you should not have eaten the seed of Śiva, as it was neither
proper nor beneficial.' When Śivā the daughter of the king of
<<chapter4.html_page_165>>mountains had thus cursed Fire, she went
quickly to her own dwelling-place, unsatisfied, Śivā went to Śiva and
reported to him accurately, and then she brought forth another son named
Gaņeśa. (I will tell that story, omitting
nothing,^{<<chapter4.html_ipg165_fn74>>[[#page_165.html#pg165_fn74][74]]}
but first hear now as I gladly tell you about the birth of Guha.)

The ageless gods eat food and other offerings whenever these are placed
in the Purifier according to Vedic custom; in this way, the seed made
all the gods pregnant. The gods were painfully afflicted by that
unbearable seed, and, moreover, Viṣņu and all the others had lost their
wits by the command of Śivā. Then all the gods, including Viṣņu, were
embarrassed and burnt, and they sought refuge immediately with the
husband of Pārvatī. They all went to the door of Śiva's house and folded
their palms together and bowed and warmly praised Śambhu and Śivā,
saying, ‘God of gods, lord, great god, lord of the daughter of the
mountain, great ruler, what has happened now? Your magic power of
illusion is impossible to fathom. We have become pregnant, and we are
being burnt by your seed. Have pity, Śambhu; undo this condition.'

When the highest lord, husband of Śivā, heard this eulogy by the
immortals, he went quickly to the door where the gods stood. Then all of
the gods, including the unfallen Viṣņu, bowed to Śaṅkara who had come
to the door; they bent low and warmly praised the god who is
affectionate to his devotees: ‘Śambhu, Śiva, great lord, we bow
particularly to you. Protect us who have come to you for refuge and who
are burning with your seed. Hara, remove [/hara/] this misery, for we
will certainly the otherwise. Who but you can remove this misery from
the gods today?' When the lord, king of the gods, heard this rather
miserable speech, he laughed, but as he was affectionate to his devotees
he replied to the gods, ‘Hari, Brahmā, and all you gods, listen to my
speech. You will be relieved today, but you must attend carefully. All
the <<chapter4.html_page_166>>gods must quickly vomit up my seed, and
then, by my command, you will be content in this particular matter.'

Viṣņu and all the other gods accepted this command, bowing their heads,
and they quickly vomited, thinking of the unchanging Śiva. That shining
golden seed of Śambhu fell upon the ground in the form of a marvellous
mountain, touching the very sky. Then all the gods, including the
unfallen Viṣņu, were relieved, and they praised Śaṅkara, the highest
lord, who is affectionate to his devotees.

But the Purifier was not content, for Śaṅkara, the supreme lord, had
given him a command and injured him. Therefore Agni folded his palms
together and bowed and praised Śiva, for his soul was not content, and
he said: ‘God of gods, great lord, I am your foolish servant. Master,
forgive my offence and remove this feverish burning, for you are
affectionate to the lowly.' Then Śambhu, the supreme lord, who is
affectionate toward the lowly, was propitiated, and he replied to the
Purifier, ‘You committed an improper act when you ate my seed; therefore
by my command the feverish burning has fallen upon you because of your
surpassing sin. But now that you have come to me for refuge you will be
relieved, Agni. I am pleased and will destroy all your misery. Leave
that seed carefully in the womb of some good woman and you will be
relieved, for, in particular, your soul will be free of the feverish
burning.'

When Fire heard Śambhu's speech, he folded his palms together, bowed,
and replied happily and gently to Śaṅkara who gives peace [/śaņkara/]
to his devotees, ‘Your
seed^{<<chapter4.html_ipg166_fn75>>[[#page_166.html#pg166_fn75][75]]} is
hard to bear, great lord and ruler. No woman in the three universes is
capable of holding it in her womb, except Śakti.' When Fire spoke in
this way, Nārada was prompted by Śaṅkara to help Agni, and he said,
‘Agni, listen to my auspicious words which will remove your feverish
burning, delight you, bring <<chapter4.html_page_167>>you supreme bliss,
and dispel all your sins. By using this expedient, your fire will be
content and without any feverish burning. I will tell you this carefully
and accurately as Śiva wishes: Fire, place this great seed of Śiva in
the bodies of those women who bathe at dawn in the month of summer.'

Now, at this time the wives of the Seven Sages came there wishing to
bathe at dawn in the month of summer, in accordance with their rites.
When they had bathed, six of the women were pained by the intense cold,
and they wished to go near the flames of the fire. Arundhatī, seeing
them behaving so stupidly, tried to prevent them, by the command of the
lord of the mountain, for she was of particularly good conduct and good
counsel. But the six wives of the sages were so deluded by Śiva's magic
power of illusion that they went there against her will in order to
dispel their chill. All the tiny particles of his seed immediately
entered their bodies through their hair follicles, and Agni was free of
his feverish burning. Then Fire quickly vanished in the form of a flame
and went happily back to his own world, thinking in his heart of
Śaṅkara and Brahmā. All of the women but Arundhatī became pregnant and
they went home, tortured by the feverish burning and suffering because
of Agni. When the husbands saw the condition of their wives, they were
quickly overcome by anger, and they all took counsel together and
abandoned their wives. When all the six women realized their
transgression, they were afflicted with great misery and their hearts
were deeply troubled. The sages' wives left the seed of Śiva in the form
of an embryo on a peak of Himālaya, and then they were free of the
feverish burning.

But the mountain Himālaya could not bear that seed of Śiva; trembling
and tortured by the feverish burning, he threw that unbearable seed into
the Ganges. Even the Ganges could not bear that seed of the highest
soul, and she threw it on her waves into a clump of reeds. When the seed
fell there it <<chapter4.html_page_168>>immediately became a boy,
handsome, well-endowed, blessed, full of energy, and a source of growing
pleasure. On the sixth lunar day in the bright half of the month when
the moon is in the constellation Deer's
Head,^{<<chapter4.html_ipg168_fn76>>[[#page_168.html#pg168_fn76][76]]}
the son of Śiva appeared on the surface of the earth. At that moment,
Pārvatī the daughter of the mountain Himālaya and Śiva the lord of the
mountain became happy for no apparent reason, on their own mountain.
Then milk flowed from the breasts of Śivā because of her joy, and
everyone went there and became very happy. An auspicious event took
place throughout the three worlds bringing happiness to the good and
obstacles to the wicked, particularly to the demons. A great sound of
drums was heard in the sky with no apparent cause, and a rain of flowers
fell upon the little boy. Supreme joy came to Viṣņu and all the gods,
as if by a miracle, and there was great jubilation.

*ŚIVA FIGHTS ANDHAKA FOR PĀRVATĪ*

Skanda and
Gaņeśa^{<<chapter4.html_ipg168_fn77>>[[#page_168.html#pg168_fn77][77]]}
are sons of Śiva whose birth is desired by some of the gods but feared
by others (notably Indra). This ambivalence is even more marked toward
other sons of Śiva who actually become demons, enemies of the gods. Of
all of these sons, Gaņeśa alone is physically connected with Pārvatī
(though even he is not born from her in the ‘natural' manner);
Jalandhara and Andhaka are demons engendered by the fire of Śiva's third
eye (like the mare) and are thus only ‘adopted' by Pārvatī (as Skanda
is). Both demons seek, unsuccessfully, to win Pārvatī from Śiva, just as
Gaņeśa sometimes competes with Śiva for Pārvatī. In the myth of
Jalandhara, this ambiguous relationship between Pārvatī and her ‘son' is
slurred over, but in the myth of Andhaka it is clearly emphasized. These
myths, in which Śiva opposes an incestuous relationship between mother
and ‘son' by injuring his own ‘son', may also be seen as inversions of
the myth of Rudra and Prajāpati, in which Rudra opposes an incestuous
<<chapter4.html_page_169>>relationship between father and daughter by
injuring his own
father.^{<<chapter4.html_ipg169_fn78>>[[#page_169.html#pg169_fn78][78]]}

Once in the past, on Mount Mandara, Pārvatī closed the eyes of the god
with braided hair, the god of fierce attack, and she did it in play, as
a jest, closing his eyes with her two lotus hands that shone like newly
sprouted coral and golden lotuses. When Hara's three eyes were shut,
total darkness fell in a
moment.^{<<chapter4.html_ipg169_fn79>>[[#page_169.html#pg169_fn79][79]]}
But from the touch of her hand, the great lord shed the liquid of
passion. A drop of that copious water came forth and splashed on
Śambhu's forehead, and it was
heated.^{<<chapter4.html_ipg169_fn80>>[[#page_169.html#pg169_fn80][80]]}
It became an infant who terrified even Gaņeśa, the elephant-headed god,
ungrateful and full of anger, strange, deformed, disfigured, a dark,
hairy man with matted locks and a beard. He sang and laughed and wept
and danced; his tongue flickered and he roared fiercely and deeply. When
this creature of marvellous aspect was born, Bhava smiled and said to
Gaurī,^{<<chapter4.html_ipg169_fn81>>[[#page_169.html#pg169_fn81][81]]}
‘You closed my eyes as a jest; how can you be afraid of me, my darling?'
When Gaurī heard what Hara had said, she laughed and released his three
eyes, and light arose, but because the hideous creature had been born in
darkness he had no eyes.

She asked, ‘My lord, who is this deformed creature? Look at him, such as
he is, and tell me truly: for what purpose was he created, and by whom,
and whose son is he?' When Hara heard the words of his beloved, he
replied, ‘This child whose <<chapter4.html_page_170>>heroic power is
marvellous and fierce was born when you closed my eyes; he was born of
sweat and is named Andhaka (‘Blind'). Therefore I am his maker, as is
fitting, and you and your girl-friends must tenderly protect him from
the other troops of Śiva for one half year; and you must consider
intelligently and carefully how to do this, good lady.' Then Gaurī was
filled with pity, and with her friends she protected her son by various
methods and many means.

At the same time that Andhaka appeared on earth, Hiraņyanetra
(‘Golden-eye'), the son of Kaśyapa, desired a son, and he went to the
forest and practised asceticism for the sake of a son. He conquered the
flaw of anger and remained motionless as a piece of wood, in order that
the great lord Śiva should appear to him. Then the god who wields the
Pināka bow was satisfied with his asceticism and went to give him a
boon, and said to him whose senses were unmoved, ‘For what purpose have
you undertaken this vow? Tell me what you desire. I am Bhava, the Giver
of Boons, and I will give you all that you wish.' ‘God with the moon on
your forehead,' replied the demon, ‘since I have no heroic son worthy of
the dynasty of demons, I have undertaken this vow. Lord of gods, give me
a heroic son. My
brother^{<<chapter4.html_ipg170_fn82>>[[#page_170.html#pg170_fn82][82]]}
has five sons of infinite heroism, Prahlāda and the others, but I have
not, and so I have no descendants, no son to adorn my kingdom, to steal
the kingdom of another by his own might and enjoy it or the kingdom
allotted properly to him by his own father. He would be called my son,
and the man who had such a son in this world would be a father. Wise men
supreme among those who know /dharma/ have said that those who have sons
find an abode above, and for this reason all creatures are compelled by
their very natures to act at the fertile season. But as there
<<chapter4.html_page_171>>are no worlds for a man who is without
descendants, they wish for sons in great abundance. There are eight
kinds of son, bought and so
forth;^{<<chapter4.html_ipg171_fn83>>[[#page_171.html#pg171_fn83][83]]}
and of these, I wish for one single son.'

When Bhava heard this speech he was full of pity, and as he was
satisfied with the king of demons he said to him, ‘Overlord of demons,
there is no son fated to be born of your seed, but I will give you a son
born of myself, named Andhaka; his heroic power is equal to yours, for
he can be conquered by no enemy. Choose this son and lose all your
misery; accept him, as he is your own happiness.' Then Hara, the noble
overlord of the ghosts, the hideous one, enemy of the triple city, gave
a son to Hiraņyanetra, for he and Gaurī were pleased to grant his wish.
When the noble demon had received the son from Hara, he walked around
Rudra in reverence and worshipped him with various hymns of praise and
then, exulting, he went to his own kingdom.

*/Śiva kills and transfigures Andhaka/*

The motif of the eye is central to the myth of Andhaka; just as he is
born of Śiva's eye, and born blind, and given to a demon named
Golden-eye, even so he is destroyed by Śiva's eye and finally purified
and reborn through it.

When he went to the Pine Forest, Śiva placed the goddess Pārvatī in the
care of Nārāyaņa, and he established as guards
<<chapter4.html_page_172>>Nandin, the joy of the family, and all the
hosts and gods led by Indra. When the great god had set out, Viṣņu, who
is himself the form of everything, took the form of a woman and served
the great empress, while Brahmā, the Oblation-eater, Śakra, Yama, and
the others who were like bulls among the gods served the great goddess
by assuming graceful female forms. The blessed lord Nandin, the overlord
of hosts, who is especially dear to Śambhu, stood at the door as before.

At this time, an evil-minded demon named Andhaka, tortured and blinded
by lust, came to Mount Mandara in order to carry off the goddess,
daughter of the mountain... Then the lord, the Rudra of the doomsday
fire, the refuge of the good, took Andhaka and placed him on the tip of
his trident and began to dance... When Andhaka was fixed on the tip of
the trident, all his sins were burnt away, and he obtained perfect
knowledge and praised the highest lord... The highest lord was pleased
with this praise and took Andhaka down from the tip of his trident and
touched him with his two hands and said, ‘Your praise has thoroughly
pleased me, demon. You will become a leader of my hosts and dwell with
me as a follower of the lord Nandin, honoured even by the gods, free
from disease or misery, and all your doubts will be dispelled.' As soon
as the god of gods had said this, the gods saw that the great demon
Andhaka had become a leader of hosts in the presence of the god, shining
like a thousand suns, three-eyed, bearing the moon, blue-necked, with
matted locks, carrying a trident, with an enormous body...

Then Hara took the son of
Hiraņyalocana^{<<chapter4.html_ipg172_fn84>>[[#page_172.html#pg172_fn84][84]]}
by the hand and went to the place where the daughter of the mountain,
the darling of the lord, was waiting. She saw her husband arrive to
dispel the pain of her heart, and she received Andhaka pleasantly and
graciously. When Andhaka saw the great empress at the side of the god,
he prostrated himself on the <<chapter4.html_page_173>>ground and bowed
to her lotus feet and praised her... The blessed goddess was pleased
with the lord of demons as he praised her, bent low in devotion, and she
accepted Andhaka as her own son.

another; the mortal ascetic uses his magic to transmute blood to plant
sap, and he dances in erotic joy, disturbing the world just as Śiva does
when he ‘dances' with Pārvatī; but then Śiva uses his own far greater
ascetic power to change blood to

The twice-born sage Maņkaņaka, the mind-born son of Kaśyapa, set out to
bathe in his bark garment, and the celestial nymphs, Rambhā and the
others, who were pleasing to look upon, shining, affectionate, and
flawless, bathed there with him. Then the sage, whose ascetic power was
great, became excited and shed his seed in the water; he collected that
seed in a pot, where it became divided into seven parts, from which were
born seven sages who are known as the bands of the Maruts: Wind-speed,
Wind-force, Wind-destroyer, Wind-circle, Wind-flame, Wind-seed, and
Wind-disc, whose heroic power is great. These seven sons of the seer
support the universe, moving and still.

Once, long ago, the Siddha Maņkaņaka was wounded in the hand by the tip
of a blade of /kuśa/ grass, and plant sap flowed from that wound -- so I
have heard. When he saw the plant sap, he was filled with joy, and he
started to dance; and <<chapter4.html_page_174>>then everything that was
moving or still started to dance; the universe started to dance, for it
was bewitched by his energy. When Brahmā and the other gods and the
sages rich in ascetic power saw this, they reported to the great god
Śiva about the sage: ‘You should do something so that he does not dance,
O god.' When the Great God saw that the sage was filled with joy to
excess, he spoke to him for the sake of the welfare of the gods, saying,
‘Best of twice-born sages, what is the reason that has occasioned this
joy in you who are an ascetic stationed on the path of /dharma/?' ‘Why,
brahmin,' said the sage, ‘do you not see the plant sap flowing from my
hand? When I saw it I began to dance with joy.'

The god laughed at the sage who was deluded by passion, and he said to
him, ‘I am not amazed, priest. Look at this,' and when Bhava, the god of
gods, of great lustre, had said this to the eminent sage, he struck his
own thumb with the tip of his finger, and from that wound ashes shining
like snow came forth. When the priest saw this he was ashamed, and he
fell at Śiva's feet and said, ‘I think that you are none other than the
noble god who holds the trident in his hand, the best in the universe
moving and still, the Trident-bearer. Brahmā and the other gods appear
to be dependent upon you, faultless one. You are the first of the gods,
the great one who acts and causes others to act. By your grace all the
gods rejoice and fear nothing.' When the sage had thus praised the great
god, he bowed and said, ‘O lord, by your favour let my ascetic power not
be destroyed.' Then the god was pleased, and he answered the sage, ‘Your
ascetic power will increase a thousand-fold by my favour, O priest, and
I will dwell in this hermitage with you for ever. Any man who bathes in
the Saptasārasvata and worships me will find nothing impossible to
obtain in this world and in the other world, but he will certainly go to
the Sārasvata world and, by the grace of Śiva, he will obtain the
highest place.'

ALTHOUGH only a small proportion of the mythology of Viṣņu can be
traced back to the /Ŗg Veda/ -- hardly any more than that of Śiva --
Viṣņu is a far more straightforward, orthodox god; those elements of
proto-Indian worship which were assimilated to his cult are generally
more benevolent, human, and conventional that those of Śiva. Of his many
avatars or
incarnations^{<<chapter5.html_ipg175_fn1>>[[#page_175.html#pg175_fn1][1]]},
only three -- Kṛṣņa, the Buddha and Kalkin -- bring moral or physical
destruction to mankind, and even these are designed ultimately to bring
about our well-being.

:PROPERTIES:

:END:
*VIṢŅU TAKES THREE STRIDES*

By far the most important Vedic myth of Viṣņu is the story of his three
steps, a creation myth based upon the Vedic concept that to measure out,
to spread, and to prop apart the elements of the universe is to create.
The magic number three, which is woven into almost all of Hindu
cosmology, appears here in Viṣņu's three /padas/:
<<chapter5.html_page_176>>this word (cognate with other Indo-European
words such as foot in English and /pes, pedis/ in Latin) has many
meanings which lend secondary overtones or resonances to this myth;
besides ‘step', /pada/ denotes (primarily) foot, and it is significant
that Viṣņu's feet are the object of worship; /pada/ may also be
translated ‘foot print', and the foot print of Viṣņu (also the object
of
worship)^{<<chapter5.html_ipg176_fn2>>[[#page_176.html#pg176_fn2][2]]}
leads the worshipper to cattle just as Saramā's footprint led Indra to
the cattle of the Paņis; and, lastly, it may signify ‘dwelling-place',
the highest of the three /padas/ being Viṣņu's heaven.

**** <<chapter5.html_myt47>>47. FROM THE /Ŗg Veda/
:PROPERTIES:
:CLASS: calibre16
:END:
I will proclaim the heroic deeds of Viṣņu, who measured apart the
earthly realms, who propped up the upper dwelling place, when the
wide-striding one stepped forth three times. Viṣņu is praised for his
heroic deed, he who stayed in the mountain wandering cruelly like a wild
beast. All creatures dwell in his three wide steps. Let the resounding
prayer go forth to Viṣņu who lives in the mountains, the wide-striding
one, the bull who alone measured apart with three steps this far
extended dwelling-place. His three footprints, inexhaustibly full of
honey, intoxicate with their own power; he alone has supported
three-fold the earth, and the sky, and all creatures. Would that I might
reach his dear dwelling place, where men who love the gods become
intoxicated; there one is joined with the wide-strider, Viṣņu, in his
highest place, the fountain of honey. We wish to go to the
dwelling-places of both of you, Viṣņu and Indra, where there are
untiring, many-homed cattle. There the highest place of the
wide-striding bull brightly shines down.

*VIṢŅU BECOMES A DWARF*

The Brāhmaņas incorporated the myth of Viṣņu's strides into the corpus
of myths dealing with gods and demons. Motifs from other
<<chapter5.html_page_177>>Vedic cycles are used to embellish the myth:
hiding from the gods (in the roots of plants, where Indra and Agni
hide)^{<<chapter5.html_ipg177_fn3>>[[#page_177.html#pg177_fn3][3]]} and
obtaining a share of the
sacrifice.^{<<chapter5.html_ipg177_fn4>>[[#page_177.html#pg177_fn4][4]]}
The Vedic concept of Viṣņu as one who expands and pervades is central
to this myth; here he actually changes from a dwarf into a giant, but in
more philosophical texts he is viewed as the microcosmic soul (/ātman/)
who is simultaneously the macrocosmic godhead
(/brahman)./^{<<chapter5.html_ipg177_fn5>>[[#page_177.html#pg177_fn5][5]]}

**** 48. FROM THE /Śatapatha Brāhmaņa/
:PROPERTIES:

:END:
The gods and the demons, both born of Prajāpati, were striving against
one another. Then the gods seemed to be left behind, and the demons
thought, ‘All this world is ours.' They said, ‘Let us divide this earth,
and when we have divided it let us live upon it.' Then they set out to
divide it from west to east with hides of oxen. The gods heard about
this and said, ‘The demons are dividing this earth. Let us go where the
demons are dividing it, for who would we be if we did not share in it?'
They placed Viṣņu, the sacrifice, at their head and went there and
said, ‘Let us also share in this earth; let a portion of it be ours.'
The demons, rather jealously, replied, ‘As much as this Viṣņu lies on,
so much we give to you.'

Now Viṣņu was a dwarf, but the gods did not contest this offer, for
they thought, ‘They have given much to us, for they have given us a
space as large as the sacrifice.' They placed Viṣņu on the east and
enclosed him all around with Vedic metres, saying, on the south, 'With
the Gāyatrī metre I enclose you'; on the west, ‘With the Triṣṭubh
metre I enclose you'; on the north, ‘With the Jagatī metre I enclose
you.' Having enclosed him with metres all around, they placed Agni
<<chapter5.html_page_178>>on the
east,^{<<chapter5.html_ipg178_fn6>>[[#page_178.html#pg178_fn6][6]]} and
they went on worshipping with him and exhausted themselves, and with him
they obtained this whole earth; and since with him they obtained
[/samavindanta/, from /vid/] this whole earth, therefore he is called
the altar [/vedi/]. And so it is said, ‘The altar is as great as the
earth'; for with the altar they obtained this whole earth. He who knows
this wrests this whole earth from his enemies and excludes his enemies
from a share.

Viṣņu was exhausted, but as he was enclosed all around by the Vedic
metres and by Agni on the east, he could not get out, and so he went
down into the roots of plants. The gods said, ‘Where has Viṣņu gone?
Where has the sacrifice gone? He is enclosed by metres all around and by
Agni on the east; he cannot have got out; let us search for him here.'
By digging a little they searched for him and found him three fingers
down. Therefore let the altar be three fingers high.

*VIṢŅU BECOMES A DWARF TO TRICK THE DEMON BALI*

The cosmology implicit in the Brāhmaņa myth is stated explicitly in the
Purāņa version: the whole universe is in Viṣņu's body. Another Vedic
thread -- Viṣņu's role as a sun god whose three ‘steps' are his rising,
noon, and setting -- is also made explicit here. The demons of the
Brāhmņas are now replaced by the individual demon, Bali (whose name,
significantly, denotes the offering of a portion of the daily meal); for
Viṣņu, who is closely associated with Indra in many Ŗg Vedic martial
exploits (including the three strides), comes to replace Indra in later
mythology as the demon-slayer /par excellence./

:PROPERTIES:

:END:
In the seventh Tretā Age, when all the worlds were controlled by Bali
and the demons had occupied the triple world, the dwarf appeared,
Viṣņu's third avatar. Contracting himself in all his limbs, he went,
preceded by Bṛhaspati, to the place where the lord of demons was
performing a sacrifice. At this <<chapter5.html_page_179>>auspicious
time, the lord, the joy of the family of Aditi, became a brahmin and
said to Bali the son of Virocana, ‘You are the king of the triple world.
In you everything is firmly placed. O king, you should give me the space
covered in three strides.' ‘I grant this,' answered the king, Bali the
son of Virocana, and since he thought him to be just a dwarf he himself
was very pleased about it. But the dwarf, the lord, stepped over the
heaven, the sky, and earth, this whole universe, in three strides; he,
the famous one, the individual soul, surpassed the sun in his own
energy, illuminating all the regions of the sky and the intermediate
points of the compass. The great-armed Viṣņu who excites men shone
forth, illuminating all the worlds, and stole away the demons'
prosperity as he stole away the three worlds. He sent the demons, with
all their sons and grandsons, to hell; Namuci, Śambara, Prahlāda --
these cruel ones were destroyed by Viṣņu and scattered in all
directions. Mādhava, the individual soul, is the essence of all the
great elements, and time with all its parts; and he revealed this wonder
to the brahmins there. He revealed that the whole universe was in his
body; there is nothing in all the worlds that is not pervaded by the
noble one. When the gods, demons, and men saw that form of the supreme
ruler, they were all bewitched by Viṣņu's energy over and over. Bali,
with his friends and relations, was bound with great cords, and the
whole family of Virocana was sent to hell. Then Viṣņu gave the noble
Indra kingship over all immortals.

*/The fish saves Manu from the flood/*

Another ancient incarnation is that of the fish. The myth of the fish
and the flood is not originally associated with Viṣņu; indeed, it is
<<chapter5.html_page_180>>likely that this myth is not only far older
than the worship of Viṣņu but even older than the Indo-European
dispersal and the civilization of the Fertile Crescent, for the
parallels with Semitic flood legends are striking.

In the morning they brought Manu water for ablutions, just as they bring
it for washing the hands. As he was washing, a fish came into his hands
and said, ‘Care for me and I will save you.' ‘From what will you save
me?' ‘A flood will carry away all these creatures; I will save you from
it.' ‘How should you be cared for?' ‘As long as we are tiny,' said the
fish, ‘our destruction is great, for fish swallows
fish.^{<<chapter5.html_ipg180_fn7>>[[#page_180.html#pg180_fn7][7]]} Care
for me at first in a pot, and when I outgrow it, dig a trench and care
for me in it. And when I outgrow that, then take me down to the ocean,
for then I will be beyond destruction.'

The fish grew steadily into a
/jhaṣa/,^{<<chapter5.html_ipg180_fn8>>[[#page_180.html#pg180_fn8][8]]}
for that grows largest. It said, ‘In a certain year, the flood will
come. Then you will build a ship and come to me, and when the flood has
risen you will enter the ship and I will save you from the flood.' Manu
cared for it in this way and carried it down to the ocean. And in the
very year which the fish had indicated, he built a ship and came to him,
and when the flood had risen he entered the ship. The fish swam up to
him, and he fastened the rope of the ship to the horn of the fish, and
with it he sailed through to the northern mountain. ‘I have saved you,'
said the fish. ‘Fasten the ship to a tree, but do not let the water cut
you off when you are on the mountain; as the water subsides, keep
following it down.' And he kept following it down, in this way, and so
that slope of the northern mountain <<chapter5.html_page_181>>is known
as Manu's Descent. The flood swept away all other creatures, and Manu
alone remained here.

*/Viṣņu becomes a fish to save Manu from the universal dissolution/*

As the central motif of the earliest Indian version of the flood myth is
one of expansion (from a minnow to a giant fish), the fish was later
identified with Viṣņu, the Expander, rather than with any of the other
Hindu gods. Once the fish had become a god, his expansion frightened
Manu just as Viṣņu's cosmic form frightened Arjuna in the /Bhagavad
Gītā/ and Kṛṣņa's cosmic form frightened his mother in the /Bhāgavata
Purāņa/;^{<<chapter5.html_ipg181_fn9>>[[#page_181.html#pg181_fn9][9]]}
in this way the fish becomes a fiery destructive force that must be
disposed of like the seed of Śiva and the submarine mare, transferred
from one body of water to another until it finds its rest in the ocean.
In fact, although the earliest plot demands that the fish /save/ Manu,
the later Hindu imagery influences the text so that the fish appears to
participate in doomsday: the submarine mare comes out of the ocean after
the fish has entered it, and a detailed description of the final
conflagration is inserted to balance the original motif of the final
flood. In keeping with these elaborations, Manu saves not merely himself
alone (which was the point of the earlier myth) but all living
creatures; he requests not his own immortality (the usual boon) but the
immortality of the human race.

**** 51. FROM THE /Matsya Purāņa/
:PROPERTIES:

:END:
In times past, a king named Manu, the child of the sun, practised
extensive asceticism and patiently handed his kingdom over to his son.
Endowed with all the qualities of the soul, equally indifferent to
sorrow and joy, the hero achieved the highest yoga in a solitary place
on the Malaya mountain range. When a million years had passed, Brahmā
who sits on a lotus was pleased and came to give him a boon, saying,
‘Choose a boon.' The king bowed to the Grandfather and
<<chapter5.html_page_182>>said, ‘There is only one unsurpassed boon that
I wish from you: let me be able to protect the multitude of all beings,
moving and still, when the dissolution takes place.' The soul of all
agreed to this and vanished. Then a great rain of flowers fell from the
sky, sent by the gods.

One day as he was performing in his hermitage the libration which
delights the ancestors, a
/śapharī/^{<<chapter5.html_ipg182_fn10>>[[#page_182.html#pg182_fn10][10]]}
fish came into his hands along with the water. When the king, who was
full of compassion, saw that fish, he took care to protect it in a
vessel of water for a day and a night, until it had the form of a fish
sixteen fingers long. Then it cried, ‘Save me! Save me!' and he threw
the water-creature into a jar, and even within that jar it grew to three
hands during one night. Again the fish said to the son of the
thousand-rayed god, in a wail of distress, ‘Save me! Save me! I have
come to you for refuge.' Then the child of the sun threw the fish into a
well, and when the fish could no longer fit even into that well, he
threw it into a vast lake; but still it grew to the width of a league,
and again it cried out there in distress, ‘Save me! Save me! O best of
kings.'

Then Manu threw it into the Ganges, and when it continued to grow, the
lord of the earth threw it into the ocean. But when the fish had
pervaded the whole ocean, Manu became frightened and said, ‘Who are you?
A lord of demons? Or are you Vāsudeva? Who else could there be like
this? Whose body could be equal to twenty thousand leagues? I have
recognized you in your fish form, Keśava; but you are wearing me out.
Homage to you, Hṛṣīkeśa, lord of the universe, dwelling-place of the
universe.'

Then the lord Viṣņu who excites men, who had taken the form of a fish,
said, ‘Bravo, bravo! You have recognized me
<<chapter5.html_page_183>>rightly, and have faultlessly kept your vow.
In a short time, the earth will be submerged in water with all its
mountains and trees and houses. This boat has been fashioned out of the
assemblage of all the gods in order to protect the assemblage of great
living souls, O lord of the earth. Those born of sweat, those born of
eggs, or of water, and those living creatures which slough their skins
-- place them all in this boat and save them, for they have no
protector. And when your ship is struck by the winds that blow at the
end of the age, fasten the ship to this horn of mine, O king, lord of
kings, lord of the earth. At the end of the dissolution, you will be the
Prajāpati of the whole universe, moving and still. Thus at the beginning
of the Kṛta Age you will be the omniscient, firm king, the overlord of
the period of Manu, worshipped even by the gods.'

Then Manu asked the Chastiser of Madhu, ‘O lord, for how many years will
the interval of destruction last? And how shall I protect the creatures,
O lord, Chastiser of Madhu? And how shall I be united with you again?'
The fish replied, ‘From today, there will be a drought upon the earth
that will last for a hundred years, when food will be scarce and
misfortune rife. Then seven cruel rays will destroy those few creatures
still left, and seven times seven rays will rain down hot coals. The
fire of the submarine mare will be transformed at the end of the Age,
and a poisonous fire will shoot forth from her
contracted^{<<chapter5.html_ipg183_fn11>>[[#page_183.html#pg183_fn11][11]]}
mouth, out of hell; and a fire will arise from the third eye in the
forehead of Bhava, burning and agitating the triple universe, great
sage. And when the whole earth has thus been burnt to ashes, the sky
will be heated by steam. Then the universe, with its gods and
constellations, will be totally destroyed. The seven clouds of doomsday
-- Whirlpool, Frightening-roar, Bucket, Fierce, Crane, Lightning-banner,
and Blood-red -- these clouds born of the sweat of Agni will
<<chapter5.html_page_184>>flood the earth; the oceans will be stirred
and will all come together, and all of the three universes will be a
single ocean.

‘Then take this boat of the Vedas and place the essences and seeds of
all living creatures upon it; and by attaching the rope as I have taught
you, fasten the boat to my horn, and you will be protected by my
majesty. You alone will remain, when even the gods have been burnt. The
moon and the sun, Brahmā and I, together with the four World-protectors,
the holy river Narmadā, the great sage Mārkaņḍeya, Bhava, the Vedas and
Purāņas and subsidiary sciences -- all of these will remain with you
during the interval of destruction of the era of Manu Cākṣuṣa, when
all is a single ocean. I will proclaim the Vedas to you at the beginning
of creation, O lord of the earth, heater of enemies.' Then the lord
vanished, and Manu practised the rope technique that Vāsudeva had
favoured him with, and practised it until the final flood occurred as it
had been foretold. When the time arrived as it had been foretold from
the mouth of Vāsudeva, Viṣņu, the Exciter of Men, appeared in the form
of a horned fish, and a serpent in the form of a rope came to Manu's
side. Then the sage who knew /dharma/ gathered together all creatures
and placed them on the boat, and by the technique of attachment he tied
the boat to the horn of the fish with the rope that was a serpent; he
approached Viṣņu, the Exciter, upon it and prostrated himself before
him.

*THE BOAR*

Like the avatar of the fish, the boar avatar was originally a part of
the mythology of the Brāhmaņas not associated with Viṣņu, but the
concepts underlying the symbolism of the boar were easily assimilated to
Viṣņu, who helps Indra to retrieve a sacrificial boar from the demons
even in the literature of the Brāhmaņas. The boar who saves the earth,
however, is originally Prajāpati, who keeps her afloat by flattening and
spreading her in a typical Vedic act of creation.

earth is called Pṛthivī (‘the Extended'). Prajāpati exhausted himself
in her, and he produced the gods, Vasus, Rudras, and Ādityas.

*/Prajāpati becomes a boar to save the earth/*

The idea of ‘extending' the earth is easily connected with the expanding
aspect of Viṣņu; similarly, the idea of the ‘saving' of the earth comes
to Viṣņu later, perhaps in association with the fish who saves the
people of the earth from submersion even as the boar saves the earth
herself

In the beginning, the earth was only the size of a hand-span. A boar
raised her up, and he was called Emūṣa; he was Prajāpati, her husband,
and she was his mate, his dear abode.

*/Viṣņu becomes incarnate as the boar to save the earth/*

From these two brief myths, the two essential symbolic qualities of the
boar are apparent: the boar is a sacrificial animal and it is ambivalent
by virtue of its amphibious nature; the boar lives in water and on land,
and in later mythology the cosmic boar dwells at the boundary of the
universe and the non-universe, ‘World-non-World', a ring of mountains
forming the boundary between the visible world and the regions of
darkness. As Viṣņu in the Purāņas takes this avatar from Brahmā, he is
explicitly identified with Brahmā: he ‘creates' the earth by finding it
in the water as Prajāpati does. The water is thus both the birth-place
and the hiding-place of the earth, for the ancient Indians believed in a
closed universe in which matter could never
<<chapter5.html_page_186>>increase, but the semblance of creation could
be produced by reordering -- by finding -- already present elements,
retrieving them over and over again from the cosmic flood.

**** <<chapter5.html_myt54>>54. FROM THE /Viṣņu Purāņa/
:PROPERTIES:
:CLASS: calibre16
:END:
When the interval between aeons was past, the lord Brahma, endowed with
the quality of goodness, arose from his night sleep and saw that the
world was empty. The supreme Nārāyaņa, incomprehensible, the lord of all
others, the lord without a beginning, the source of everything, he who
has the very form of Brahmā -- he is called Nārāyaņa for the reason
explained in this verse about the god who has the very form of Brahmā
and is the beginning and end of the universe: ‘The waters are called
Nārā, for the waters are the offspring of the Man [/nara/]; and as they
were formerly his abode [/ayana/], therefore he is known as
Nārāyaņa.'^{<<chapter5.html_ipg186_fn12>>[[#page_186.html#pg186_fn12][12]]}
Realizing that the earth was within the waters when the universe had
been made into a single ocean, Prajāpati wished to raise it. He made
another body; as at the beginning of previous aeons he had made the
fish, the tortoise, and others, so now the eternal, constant, supreme
soul, the soul of the universe, Prajāpati took the body of a boar, a
form composed of the Vedic sacrifice, in order to preserve the whole
universe.

Then he who is the supporter of the earth, the support of the soul, was
praised by Sanaka and the other Siddhas who had gone to the world of
men, and he entered the water. When the goddess earth saw that he had
entered the subterranean region of hell, she bowed to him in humble
devotion, and she praised him... While the blessed supporter of the
earth was being praised by the earth in this way, he murmured a
resonant, low growl like the chanting of the /Sāma Veda/. Then the great
boar, whose eyes were like full-blown lotuses, and whose body, as dark
and smooth as blue <<chapter5.html_page_187>>lotus petals, resembled the
great Dark Blue Mountain, lifted the earth up from the regions of hell
on his own tusk. As he rose up, the water that had touched him was
driven by the wind from his mouth and washed Sananda and the other
shining sages who had taken refuge in the world of men, so that they
were purified of their sins. The roaring waters rushed down into hell,
which had been torn open by the tips of his hooves; and the winds of his
breath scattered all about the Siddhas who dwelt in the world of men.

As the great boar arose, holding the earth, his belly dripping with
water, shaking his great body that was made of the Vedas, the sages who
had gone between his bristles praised him... As the supreme soul,
supporter of the earth, was praised in this way, he lifted the earth up
quickly and placed her upon the great ocean. The earth stayed like a
great ship on the top of the flood of water and did not sink, because
her body was so spread out. Then, when he had made the earth level, the
lord who has no beginning, the highest lord, piled up mountains on the
earth in order to divide it. By means of his power which is never in
vain, he whose wish is never in vain created on the surface of the earth
all those mountains which had been burnt in the previous creation. He
divided the earth into seven continents as it had been, and he created
the four worlds, earth and the
others,^{<<chapter5.html_ipg187_fn13>>[[#page_187.html#pg187_fn13][13]]}
as before.

*/The Śaiva version: Śiva chastises the boar/*

Even in the Vaiṣņava story of the boar avatar there are hints of
incidental destruction caused by the boar; these hints are made the
central point of the Śaiva version of the myth, which exaggerates the
erotic element (which is already present, albeit sketchily, in the
/Śatapatha Brāmaņa/) and explains the boar's fatal flaw in social,
ritual, and cosmic terms: he becomes too attached to his family, makes
love to a polluted woman (as Agni makes love to the Kṛttikās when they
are menstruous, according to some versions), and is unable
<<chapter5.html_page_188>>to control his destructive fire once it has
been loosed. On the first level, the earth herself shares his
ambivalence: both of them know what should be done, but they are unable
to do it without the help of Śiva. On the ritual level, the polluting
‘blood' is expiated by a blood sacrifice of the
boar.^{<<chapter5.html_ipg188_fn14>>[[#page_188.html#pg188_fn14][14]]}
And on the cosmic level, there are three multiforms of the postponement
of doomsday: first the playful boars dive into the ocean, then they all
fall into the ocean during the battle, and finally they are killed and
thrown into the ocean. Doomsday is imminent; Viṣņu takes the form of a
fish and saves the Vedas, as he does at the final flood.

:PROPERTIES:

:END:
When Viṣņu had become incarnate as the boar in the primeval creation,
Śaṅkara said to the boar, the lord of all, lord of the universes, ‘O
lord, you have now fulfilled the purpose for which you fashioned the
boar form, for you have re-established the earth properly as she was,
and settled the oceans and the rivers of the earth. And Brahmā has
performed creation by your grace, for you are the substance of
everything, substance of the sacrifice, and substance of energy itself.
You are the guru of all gurus; you are beyond the beyond. The earth
cannot bear you, O lord of the universe, and she is almost shattered,
though formerly you bound her fast by placing the mountains firmly upon
her. Therefore, lord of the universes, you should abandon this body of a
boar which is the substance of the universe, the form of the universe,
the cause of the cause of the universe. Who else could bear your boar
form, except you yourself, O lord? The earth, in the water, is full of
desire and behaving like a woman; she has been violated and has
conceived a cruel embryo from your fiery seed; she is menstruating,
however, and therefore unfit for the embryo with which you impregnated
her, O lord of the universe. Therefore the son who will be born will
also carry off unrestrained <<chapter5.html_page_189>>women; he will
develop a demonic nature and harm the gods and
Gandharvas.'^{<<chapter5.html_ipg189_fn15>>[[#page_189.html#pg189_fn15][15]]}

Thus the lord of the world spoke to Viṣņu, who had a shameful look,
about the vicious son begotten by sexual pleasure with a menstruating
woman, a son who would do unpleasant things: ‘Abandon this lustful
boar-body, lord of the world; you alone are the cause of creation,
preservation, and destruction; you are the cause of the world. At the
proper time, you will bring about preservation, creation, and
destruction; therefore, for the sake of the welfare of the world,
abandon this body, mighty one. At the proper time, you will make another
boar-body again.' When the lord who had the form of a boar heard this
speech of the noble Śaṅkara, he said to the great god, ‘I will do
precisely as you say, great lord. I will certainly abandon this body of
the sacrificial boar, and at the proper time I will again make another
marvellous body of a boar, one that is hard to strike against, in order
to create the worlds.' And when he had said this, the great-bodied one,
guru of the universe, creator of the universe, supporter of the
universe, lord of the universe, disappeared. When that god had
disappeared, the great lord god Śiva went to his own place, with all the
bands of gods and his own hosts.

But the boar went to his own mountain, named World-non-World, and he
made love with the earth, who had the form of a lovely female boar, and
though he made love with her for a very long time on that supreme
mountain the lord of the world was still unsatisfied, as his lust for
the female boar was so strong. Three excellent brahmin sons were born of
the earth when she made love in the form of a female boar; their names
were Suvṛtta, Kanaka, and
Ghora,^{<<chapter5.html_ipg189_fn16>>[[#page_189.html#pg189_fn16][16]]}
and they were all <<chapter5.html_page_190>>very powerful. These
children played affectionately together in the caverns and lakes on the
various levels of the tablelands of the golden mountain Meru. The boar,
surrounded by these sons, made love with his wife and did not consider
giving up his body. Sometimes the powerful boar embraced his children
and played games in the mud with his wife; when the boar, tawny as
honey, was smeared with mud he shone forth like a cloud at sunset, and
he splashed his family with water just like a cloud. He was so delighted
with his sons and with his wife, the earth, that he played until he
shattered the earth so that she bent in the middle. The serpent Ananta
was also tortured by the pressure, for he carried Hari; his head was
broken and he trod upon the tortoise on the surface of the earth.
Suvṛtta, Ghora, and Kanaka split open the golden tablelands with their
boarish blows, and when the gold was broken the tablelands became flat,
and all those golden things which the gods had carefully wrought on the
tablelands of Meru were broken by the boar's sons. Then the boarish
blows of the children made Mānasa and the other lakes of the gods turbid
everywhere.

The earth in the form of a woman played with the boar, but in her stable
form she was intensely unhappy. Suvṛtta and the others plunged into the
ocean on all sides, and all the oceans were whipped up as their gems
were strewn about by the inundations of boars. As the young boars played
here and there, the universes with their rivers and
wishing-trees^{<<chapter5.html_ipg190_fn17>>[[#page_190.html#pg190_fn17][17]]}
were broken. Even though the boar himself, supporter of the universe,
knew that the universe was tortured in this way, his love for his sons
kept him from restraining them. When Suvṛtta, Kanaka, and Ghora went to
heaven, the bands of gods were frightened and ran away in all
directions. As the sacrificial boar thus played with his sons and his
wife, he never became sated, but his desire grew ever and ever greater
and he <<chapter5.html_page_191>>did not want to abandon his body as he
had been instructed to do.

Then all the bands of gods took counsel together with the offspring of
the gods and with Śakra, for the welfare of the universe. And they all
came to a decision with Śakra and the sages and went to the refuge of
all refuges, Nārāvaņa the unborn lord. When the thirty-three gods
reached Govinda, the son of Vasudeva, lord of the universe, they bowed
and praised the god who has Garuḍa on his banner: ‘... In fear and
devotion we have come to you for refuge; protect us, Viṣņu.' When the
god of gods, cause of the welfare of all beings, was praised in this
way, he said to all the bands of gods and Indra, in a voice deep as a
thundercloud, ‘Tell me quickly why you have come or what you are afraid
of or what I can do.' ‘The earth is crushed by the constant play of the
sacrificial boar,' said the gods. ‘All the worlds are shaken and find no
peace. As a dry gourd is shattered by blows, so the earth is shattered
by the blows of the boar's hooves. And the three sons of the boar,
Suvṛtta, Kanaka, and Ghora -- they too assail the universe, O lord of
the universes, for their energy is like the doomsday fire. Mānasa and
the other lakes are so muddied and torn up by their mud games that they
now do not return to their natural state. The powerful boars have broken
the trees of the gods, the coral trees in Indra's paradise and the
others, and they have blocked the rivers of the gods with bits of fruit
and flowers. When Suvṛtta and the other two mounted the Triple Peak,
they made such a deluge as they fell into the ocean of salt that they
stirred up inundations of water that flooded the whole earth. All the
people were flooded and ran away in all directions, O great-armed one;
trying to save their lives, they ran away in all directions. When the
little sons of the sacrificial boar went to Indra's heaven, the gods
were routed on one side and another, and found no peace. The peaks of
all the mountains where the <<chapter5.html_page_192>>sons of the boar
play have been smashed and brought down. O lord of the universe, lord,
Vaikuņṭha, the whole universe is being destroyed by them as they play
their games; therefore you must protect the universe.'

When the god who causes men to prosper heard the speech of the gods as
they complained in this way, he said to Śaṅkara and Brahmā, ‘Because of
the boar's body, all the gods and all these creatures are suffering
greatly, and the whole universe is shattered. Śaṅkara, I wish to
abandon that boar-body which is still capable of atonement, but I cannot
abandon it by my own will; you, Śaṅkara, must now make an effort to
cause me to abandon that body. Brahmā, you must fill the destroyer of
Smara with your own energies, again and again, and let all the gods fill
him, and let Śaṅkara slay the boar. Because it had intercourse with a
menstruating woman, and because it murdered brahmins, the body has
become a source of evil, and it is proper to abandon it now. I will
perform a great expiation, and my offspring will perform acts of
expiation; for the sake of that, subdue my body quickly. I should always
protect creatures, but now they are steadily sinking to ruin because of
me every day; therefore I will abandon this body for the sake of all
creatures.'

Brahmā and Śaṅkara replied to Govinda, the son of Vasudeva, ‘We will do
as you say.' The son of Vasudeva then dismissed all of the thirty-three
gods and became intent upon meditating so that he himself might withdraw
the energy of the boar. As Mādhava withdrew the energy little by little,
the body of the boar became drained of its vital essence. And when all
the immortals knew that the body was devoid of energy, the god Śiva
approached the marvellous sacrificial boar. All of the thirty-three
gods, led by Brahmā, followed the great god, husband of Umā, in order to
give their energy to the Chastiser of Smara: all of the bands of gods
gave their own energy to Śiva whose banner bears the bull, and by this
means he became <<chapter5.html_page_193>>extremely powerful. At that
moment, Śiva the lord of the mountain took the form of the /śarabha/
beast, a terrifying form with eight legs, some on top and some on the
bottom. He was two hundred thousand leagues tall, one hundred and fifty
thousand leagues wide; the body of the boar was one hundred thousand
leagues high and fifty thousand leagues wide. Then the sacrificial boar
saw the great god, husband of Umā, in the terrifying form of the
/śarabha/, the colour of black coals, touching the moon with his head,
with a very long nose and long claws, with a long mouth and a giant
body, with eight tusks and a mane and a tail, with long ears. He had
four legs on his back and four on his stomach; he roared and leapt up
again and again.

When Suvṛtta, Kanaka, and Ghora saw him coming, running swiftly and
angrily, they were beside themselves with anger, and the three mighty
brothers attacked that /śarabha/ whose body was so great and tossed him
up all together with the blows of their tusks. As great as was the
measure of the /śarabha/, so great a measure did the three boars assume
by means of their magical powers as they tossed up the /śarabha/. When
the /śarabha/ was tossed up by the blows of those boars, he fell to the
farthest edge of the earth, into the deep ocean of water, and when he
had fallen into the ocean that was the abode of sharks and sea-monsters,
the three flew up and plunged furiously into the great ocean. When
Suvṛtta, Kanaka, and Ghora had plunged into the water of the ocean, the
boar also flew up suddenly in fury and plunged into that mass of water
because of his love of his sons.

When all the boars and the /śarabha/ had flown up, they had shattered
the gods in heaven, and the constellations and planets. Some of the gods
were wounded and some fell to the earth; some wise gods sought refuge in
the Mahar
world.^{<<chapter5.html_ipg193_fn18>>[[#page_193.html#pg193_fn18][18]]}
The <<chapter5.html_page_194>>constellations fell from their heavenly
cars^{<<chapter5.html_ipg194_fn19>>[[#page_194.html#pg194_fn19][19]]} to
the surface of the earth, where they appeared garlanded with flames. The
violent blast that arose when they fell gave rise to a violent storm of
wind which raised the mountains up one after the other off the surface
of the earth. Some of the peaks fell back down among the mountains,
smashing the trees and living creatures, falling down again and again.
Other mountains danced upon the surface of the earth, and with each blow
the mountains shattered many creatures as they moved, and as the
mountains rubbed against one another in the blast of the wind they
seemed to be walking along on the surface of the earth.

As the boars and the /śarabha/ and the mountains with their great peaks
fell into the ocean, masses of water were hurled up. By the blast of the
impacts that caused such masses of water to be hurled up, all the oceans
became emptied of their water in a moment, and when all those waters
were cast upon the surface of the earth all creatures were flooded in a
moment and destroyed. As the creatures were drowning in the water
everywhere, they moaned piteously, terrified and tortured as they were
about to die: ‘Alas, father!' ‘Alas, my little one!' ‘Alas, mother!'
‘Alas, my child!' The earth sank down in the place where the /śarabha/
and the boars had fallen, split open by the blast of their feet, and the
other edge of the earth rose up with all of its mountains... When all
the universe was thus flooded by the oceans and dissolved, the
Grandfather, eldest of the gods, became worried and said to Hari, ‘My
lord, this whole universe with its gods, demons and men is in ruins; the
earth is shattered, and all that moves and is still is destroyed. Gods,
demons, Gandharvas, sages, ascetics, and even the reptiles that crawl --
all are ruined, O lord of the universe. You are the protector of all;
you are the lord of the universe; therefore, protect all of us and the
earth. You yourself must <<chapter5.html_page_195>>withdraw and absorb
this boar's body and restore the earth with all that moves and is still,
great-armed one.'

When the god who brings prosperity to people, the un-fallen one, heard
this speech of Brahmā, he made every effort to restore the earth. Hari
assumed the form of a red
fish^{<<chapter5.html_ipg195_fn20>>[[#page_195.html#pg195_fn20][20]]}
who took up the Vedas and the seven sages, those excellent sages well
versed in all the Vedas, for he was determined that the Vedas should not
be destroyed and he wished for the welfare of the universe. He took them
all: Vasiṣṭha, Atri, Kaśyapa, Viśvāmitra, Gautama, Jamadagni, and
Bharadvāja, sages rich in asceticism, and he placed them on his back as
he stood in the middle of the water, and he built a great ship so that
those supreme sages could preserve their lines of descent.

Then the god who brings prosperity to people went to win Śiva's pardon,
where Śiva, fighting with the boars, was exhausted by them, wounded by
the boars' blows, his mouth open as he breathed hard. When the boar saw
that Hari had arrived, he remembered his former shape as the
Man-lion,^{<<chapter5.html_ipg195_fn21>>[[#page_195.html#pg195_fn21][21]]}
and as soon as he remembered the Man-lion the latter came there for the
sake of his friend the boar. And when the boar saw that the Man-lion had
arrived, he took the energy from that body, and the boars and the
/śarabha/ saw that energy which was the equal of the sun as it entered
into Viṣņu. The boar emitted many sighs when he realized that the
Man-lion was devoid of energy, and the sighs became many boars of great
proportions, with sharp tusks... The divine Hari, the boar,
<<chapter5.html_page_196>>approached the /śarabha/ and said again, ‘I
must certainly abandon this body for the sake of the universe. This is
what I promised before, and it was because of that promise that Hari,
Śambhu, and Brahmā have undertaken this great enterprise.' The supreme
lord, the hog, continued to deliberate about this and then said to the
great god, the powerful /śarabha/, ‘Kill me, great god, and I will
certainly abandon this body for the welfare of all universes and the
gods and even their enemies. And with the collection of the limbs of my
body you must perform a sacrifice with an animal slaughter, and a ritual
ladle and the other requisites, each of you receiving a great portion of
the animal. Perform three sacrifices with my three sons, Kanaka,
Suvṛtta, and Ghora, for the sake of the three universes. Gods and
creatures arise out of the sacrifice, for the sacrifice is their
appointed food. Everything will always arise from the sacrifice; this
whole universe is made of the sacrifice. And the embryo which the earth
received when she was menstruating -- the goddess earth herself will
care for him secretly for a long time after his birth, and when the
proper time has come the goddess, suffering under her extreme burden,
will announce to you the time for his slaughter, and then you will kill
him. When the earth, suffering under the burden, has sunk down for a
hundred leagues, I will take the form of a tusked boar and raise her up.
But your son who will be the general of the army of the gods, born of
Rudra but said to have six
mothers,^{<<chapter5.html_ipg196_fn22>>[[#page_196.html#pg196_fn22][22]]}
will then cause me to abandon that body when it has accomplished its
purpose.'

As the mighty sacrificial boar said this, the great energy came out of
the boar's body, shining with its garland of flames like the light often
million suns, and this most miraculous energy entered into the body of
the lord Hari. And when that energy of the boar had entered Viṣņu, Hari
himself took the energy from Suvṛtta, Kanaka, and Ghora. A portion of
<<chapter5.html_page_197>>energy came out from each of their bodies
separately, shining with its garland of flames, and entered the body of
Hari as their father's had done. Then Hari and Brahmā and the great god
replied to the boar's speech, saying,
‘Om',^{<<chapter5.html_ipg197_fn23>>[[#page_197.html#pg197_fn23][23]]}
again and again, and they tried as hard as they could to cause the boars
to abandon their bodies. The /śarabha/ struck his beak upon the middle
of the neck of the boar and broke it and hurled that form into the
water. When he had caused him to fall first of all, he then broke
Suvṛtta's neck and killed him, then Kanaka's, and then Ghora's, and
they all gave up their life's breath and fell into the water of the
great ocean, causing the water to echo with the noise and to blaze like
the doomsday fire when the boars fell.

*** The Epic avatars of Viṣņu
:PROPERTIES:
:CLASS: calibre11
:END:
*RĀMA: RĀMA REJECTS SĪTĀ AND IS ENLIGHTENED BY THE GODS*

The story of Rāma the mortal king was certainly known in India for
centuries before Rāma was elevated to the status of an avatar of Viṣņu;
even in the /Rāmāyaņa/, the /locus classicus/ (and by far the earliest
extensive text) for the Rāma myth, only the two latest books (the first
and seventh, accretions framing the earlier six books) refer to him
consistently as a god. This ambivalence is apparent in the episode of
Sītā's ordeal, which is placed in the sixth book in the critical
edition, though earlier tradition placed it in the seventh. In fact,
another version of this episode occurs in the seventh book, where Sītā
enters the earth, her mother, instead of the fire, and is not restored
to Rāma.

This is a myth of revelation and epiphany, unusual in that it is to the
god -- mortal himself that his divinity is revealed. Rāma's delusion is
evident from his cruel, selfish, pompous treatment of Sītā (though
elsewhere in the Epic he betrays an even greater lack of chivalry,
particularly in his unprovoked mockery and mutilation of Śūrpanakhā);
<<chapter5.html_page_198>>and he unwittingly supplies proof of his
‘blindness' when he remarks that Sītā is offensive to him ‘as a lamp to
one whose eyes are diseased' and that he regards her ‘with a jaundiced
eye'. The basis of his boastful rejection of Sītā -- that he, a mortal
man, has accomplished such prodigies in battle for the sake of his
illustrious (mortal) family, and that he cares more about appearances
and public opinion than about the happiness of himself and his wife --
is totally undercut and dwarfed by the revelation that he is not a
mortal at all.

This episode takes place when, after Sītā has been carried off by the
demon Rāvaņa and won back, after many years of battle, by Rāma, she is
summoned to come to him at court.

**** <<chapter5.html_myt56>>56. FROM THE /Rāmāyaņa/

:END:
When Rāma saw
Maithilī^{<<chapter5.html_ipg198_fn24>>[[#page_198.html#pg198_fn24][24]]}
standing humbly by his side, he spoke with anger deep in his heart: ‘I
have won you, fair lady, by conquering my enemy in battle; I have
accomplished what was to be done through manliness. Now I have satisfied
my jealousy and wiped out the insult; I have simultaneously obliterated
both the dishonour and my enemy. Today my manliness has been
demonstrated; today my efforts have borne fruit. Today, by fulfilling my
promise, I have become master of myself. The stain brought about by
fate, when you were separated from me and carried off by the
fickle-minded demon -- that has been overcome by me, a mortal man. He
who is dishonoured and does not wipe out the insult by means of his own
energy -- what good is the manliness of a man of so little energy? The
great deeds of Hanūmat -- the leaping over the ocean, the destruction of
Laṅkā, the trick that he played -- all these have now borne fruit. The
great effort of Sugrīva and his army -- his valour when attacking, his
cunning when giving me advice -- today that has borne fruit. And the
great assistance of the devoted Vibhīṣaņa, who abandoned his worthless
<<chapter5.html_page_199>>brother and came to me of himself -- today
that has borne fruit.'

When Sītā heard Rāma speak in this way, her eyes which were as wide open
as those of a doe filled with tears. But as Rāma looked at her, his
anger grew great once again, and he blazed like a fire into which great
quantities of butter have been offered. He frowned and looked askance,
and he spoke harshly to Sītā in the midst of the monkeys and the
Rākṣasas, saying, ‘I have done all that a man should do to wipe out an
intolerable insult at the hands of an enemy. I won you, Sītā, just as
the great-souled sage
Agastya^{<<chapter5.html_ipg199_fn25>>[[#page_199.html#pg199_fn25][25]]}
won the unassailable southern realm for the world of living creatures,
by means of his asceticism. But let it be known, if you please, that
this great battle effort accomplished by means of the heroism of my
friends was not undertaken by me for your sake. I protected my own
reputation and expunged completely the scandal and degradation which had
been cast upon my own famous family line.

‘But as you stand before me, doubts have arisen about your behaviour, so
that you are as deeply offensive to me as a lamp to one whose eyes are
diseased. Go then wherever you wish, in any direction, with my
permission, daughter of Janaka. I can have nothing to do with you, good
lady. What man of energy, born into a good family, could take back a
woman who had lived in the house of another man, simply because his mind
was so tortured by longing for her? Looking with a jaundiced eye upon
you who have been degraded upon the lap of Rāvṁa, how can I take you
back when I boast of such an exalted family line? The purpose for which
I won you back was to regain my own fame, since I have no attachment to
you, and you may go from here as you wish. This is my pronouncement,
<<chapter5.html_page_200>>now that I have applied my intelligence to the
matter, good lady. Set your mind on Lakṣmaņa or Bharata or wherever you
will be happy; set your heart on Sugrīva the king of the monkeys or
Vibhīṣaņa the king of the Rākṣasas, or wherever you will be happy,
Sītā. For when Rāvaņa saw your captivating, divine body, he would not
have held back for long when you were dwelling in his own house.'

When Maithilī, who deserved to hear pleasant words, heard this
unpleasant speech from her beloved after such a long time, she burst
into tears and trembled violently like a clinging vine torn down by the
trunk of a great elephant. As Rāghava spoke to her so angrily and
harshly that her hair stood on end, the daughter of the king of Videha
was greatly agitated. When Maithilī heard the rough words of her
husband, such as she had never heard before, spoken in the midst of a
great crowd, she was deeply ashamed and embarrassed. The daughter of
Janaka shed torrents of tears which seemed to cause her limbs to shrink,
as she was pierced by his words that were like arrows. Then she wiped
her face that was wet with tears and spoke to her husband in gentle and
faltering words, saying, ‘Why do you speak such rough words, cruel to
the ears, inappropriate to me, O hero, like a common man to a common
woman? I am not such as you believe, great-armed one. Have confidence in
me; I swear to you that I have behaved properly. Because of the conduct
of other individual women, you distrust the whole sex; but abandon this
doubt, since you have tested me. If my limbs were touched, it was by
force, my lord; I did not desire to do it, but fate brought about this
offence. My heart, which is under my control, is ever attached to you;
not being mistress of the situation, what could I do about my limbs
which were in the control of someone else? If you who have given me
honour still do not know me by the constantly growing affection of our
intimate contact, then I am destroyed for ever. O hero, why did you not
<<chapter5.html_page_201>>discard me when you sent the hero Hanūmat to
look for me when I was on Laṅkā? I would have abandoned my life as soon
as I heard the monkey deliver your message that you had discarded me.
Then you would not have wasted all this effort, risking your life, nor
would your friends have exhausted themselves fruitlessly like this.
Tiger among men, by giving way to anger like a trivial man you have made
womankind preferable. Though I derive my name from Janaka, my birth was
from the surface of the earth; you who understand conduct have not
honoured my great conduct. You have not had faith in the chastity of my
hand which you
pressed^{<<chapter5.html_ipg201_fn26>>[[#page_201.html#pg201_fn26][26]]}
as a young boy, when I was just a young girl; and my devotion, and my
nature -- all this you have cast behind you.'

As she spoke and wept, stammering in her tears, Sītā said to Lakṣmaņa,
who was standing there deep in sad thought, ‘Build a pyre for me; that
is the medicine for this calamity. Destroyed by false accusations, I
cannot live; abandoned in an assembly of people by my husband, who is no
longer pleased by my virtues, the only possible thing for me to do is to
enter the Oblation-bearer.' When Lakṣmaņa, the slayer of hostile
enemies, heard what the daughter of Videha said, he was overcome by
indignation, and he looked at Rāghava's face. But when he understood the
wish of Rāma's heart as revealed by his gestures, the heroic Lakṣmaņa
built the pyre as Rāma indicated. Then the daughter of Videha quietly
and reverently walked around Rāma, who stood with his head down, and she
approached the blazing Oblation-eater. Maithilī bowed to the divinities
and to the brahmins, folded her palms, stood before the fire, and said,
‘As my heart never wavered from Rāghava, so may the fire, the witness of
all people, protect me.' As the daughter of Videha said this, she walked
around the Oblation-eater and entered the blazing fire, her inner soul
totally detached. <<chapter5.html_page_202>>The great throng of people
there, children and old people, saw Maithilī enter the Oblation-eater,
and as she entered the fire a loud, horrified cry of mourning arose from
the Rākṣasas and monkeys.

Then king Kubera the wide-famed, and Yama who wears away those who are
hostile, and the thousand-eyed great Indra and Varuņa who heats his
enemies and the blessed three-eyed great god Śiva who has the bull on
his banner and Brahmā the best of those who know the Vedas, maker of all
people -- all of these, the best of the thirty-three gods, came together
in their celestial chariots that shone like the sun, and they came to
the city of Laṅkā and approached Rāghava and stretched forth their
massive arms adorned with rings and said to Rāma, who stood before them
with his palms joined, ‘Maker of all people, best of the wise, how can
you disregard Sītā as she falls into the Oblation-bearer? How is it that
you do not recognize yourself as the best of the bands of gods? Formerly
you were the Vasu Ŗtadhāman, the progenitor of the Vasus; you are the
Self-created, the first cause of the three worlds, the eighth Rudra of
the Rudras, the fifth of the Sādhyas. Your two ears are the Aśvins, your
two eyes the sun and the moon. Heater of enemies, you are seen by all
people at the beginning and at the end; yet you disregard the daughter
of Videha as if you were a common man.'

When Rāghava, Rāma, the best of upholders of /dharma/, the master of the
world, was thus addressed by the World-protectors, the best of the
thirty-three gods, he said to them, ‘I consider myself to be a man,
Rāma, the son of Daśaratha. O lord, tell me who I am, whose son, and
where I come from.' Then Brahmā, the best of those who know the Vedas,
said to Kākutstha, ‘Hear the truth from me, Rāma, you who have truth as
your valour. You are the god Nārāyaņa, the blessed lord who carries four
weapons;^{<<chapter5.html_ipg202_fn27>>[[#page_202.html#pg202_fn27][27]]}
you are the boar with one <<chapter5.html_page_203>>tusk, the conquerer
of all forces in the past and in the future... Sītā is Lakṣmī, and you
are the god Viṣņu, Kṛṣņa, Prajāpati. In order to slay Rāvaņa, you
entered into a mortal man's body here, and you have completed this task
for us, O best of those who uphold /dharma/. Rāvaņa has been slain; now
rejoice, Rāma, and enter heaven...' When the shining fire heard these
auspicious words uttered by the Grandfather, he rose up with the
daughter of Videha in his lap and placed in the lap of Rāma the wise
young daughter of Videha, who shone like the young
sun,^{<<chapter5.html_ipg203_fn28>>[[#page_203.html#pg203_fn28][28]]}
her hair dark and wavy, adorned with gold that had been purified by
fire, wearing red garments, and garlands that did not
wither.^{<<chapter5.html_ipg203_fn29>>[[#page_203.html#pg203_fn29][29]]}

Then the purifying fire, the witness of the world, said to Rāma, ‘Here
is your Sītā, daughter of Videha, and there is no evil in her. Neither
in speech nor in mind, nor in thought nor in glance, has this woman of
good conduct, of exalted conduct, transgressed against you. When you
left her alone in the deserted forest, and she was miserable and
powerless, she was carried away by the Rāksaṣa Rākṣasa, who was proud
of his virility. Though imprisoned and hidden away in the inner
apartments of the women, she set her thoughts on you and was intent upon
you; guarded by throngs of deformed, hideous Rāk̋asa women, Maithilī was
tempted and threatened in various ways, but she never gave a thought to
that Rākṣasa, for her inner soul had gone to you. Accept her, Rāghava,
for she is pure in her whole essence and without evil. And she is not to
be struck at all; this I command you.'

When Rāma, of great energy, forbearance, and firm valour, the best of
the upholders of /dharma/, heard this, he said
<<chapter5.html_page_204>>to the best of the thirty-three gods, ‘It was
necessary that the lovely Sītā should enter the purifying fire in the
presence of all people in the triple world, for she had lived for a long
time in the inner chambers of Rāvaņa. Had I not purified the daughter of
Janaka, good people would say of me, “That Rāma, the son of Daśaratha,
is certainly lustful and childish.” I know full well that Maithilī, the
daughter of Janaka, has given her heart to no other, that she is devoted
and has kept her thoughts always upon me, but in order to convince the
people of the triple world that she spoke the truth, I spurned the
daughter of Videha when she entered the Oblation-eater. Just as the
great ocean cannot violate the seashore, so Rāvaņa was unable to violate
this wide-eyed lady, for she was protected by her own energy. The
evil-minded one could not rape Maithilī even in his mind, for she was
unattainable as the blazing flame of a fire. This lovely woman could not
have presided over the inner apartments of Rāvaņa, for she belongs to no
one but me, just as light belongs to the sun. Maithilī, the daughter of
Janaka, has been purified in the presence of all people in the three
worlds. I could not abandon her, any more than one who is master of
himself can forsake fame. Certainly I will do what all of you,
affectionate ones who are revered by all people, have said for my
welfare.'

When he had said this speech and was praised by the mighty because of
the deeds that he himself had done, the mighty Rāma, descendant of
Raghu, was united with his beloved and experienced the happiness which
he deserved.

**** KŖṢŅA
:PROPERTIES:
:CLASS: calibre16
:END:
Like Rāma, Kṛṣņa is an ‘Epic' figure in two senses of the word: he
appears in one of the two great Sanskrit Epics (the /Mahābhārata/), and
he is a hero of the Epic type, a warrior and a king. But unlike Rāma,
Kṛṣņa is not the central figure in his Epic; he is (like Rāma) a
mortal warrior, but merely one among many, and his identification with
<<chapter5.html_page_205>>Viṣņu only begins to take place in the latest
parts of the Epic. The myth of the child Kṛṣņa is only dimly
foreshadowed in Vedic and Epic texts, though it may have been a very old
folk legend in the non-Sanskrit tradition (as yet unconnected with the
god Viṣņu), and this part of the Kṛṣņa cycle is first told in full in
the /Harivaṃśa/, the Purāņic appendage to the /Mahābhārata/.

*/Kṛṣņa and Balarāma are conceived by Devakī and transferred to other
mothers/*

Two motifs in the myth of the birth of Kṛṣņa have long been noted as
being strikingly similar to Christian, Greek, and other widespread
myths: the slaughter of the innocents and the royal or divine child
raised by foster-parents ignorant of his true majesty. Yet the
particularly /Indian/ elements of this myth by far outweigh the more
universal themes and place the Kṛṣņa story securely in the midst of
the great patterns of Hindu mythology.

The embryo that threatens and must be divided is reminiscent of the
stories of Indra and the Maruts and of Skanda and the
Kṛttikās.^{<<chapter5.html_ipg205_fn30>>[[#page_205.html#pg205_fn30][30]]}
Moreover, there are stronger reverberations of the Skanda myth in the
complicated incidence of multiple wombs and multiple mothers: both
Kṛṣņa and Balarāma originate in the waters of hell, which is the womb
of Kālī; they are then placed in Devakī's womb, whence Balarāma is
transferred before birth to the womb of Rohiņī and both are transferred
after birth to the home of Yaśodā. (This multiplicity of wombs and
children is further complicated by the fact that one Sanskrit word --
/garbha/ -- may refer to womb, mother, embryo, or offspring, depending
upon the context.) Thus Kṛṣņa is a king disguised as a commoner, as
well as a god masquerading as a mortal.

Another tie with the Śiva corpus may be seen in the third child, Sleep,
an aspect of Kālī who appears as Night in the Skanda myth; she colours
the embryo of Pārvatī black so that, years later, Pārvatī quarrels with
Śiva and goes away to obtain a golden
skin.^{<<chapter5.html_ipg205_fn31>>[[#page_205.html#pg205_fn31][31]]}
In the Kṛṣņa myth, Kālī appears first as Sleep (a manifestation of
Viṣņu's <<chapter5.html_page_206>>magic power of
illusion),^{<<chapter5.html_ipg206_fn32>>[[#page_206.html#pg206_fn32][32]]}
then as Night and as a dream, and finally as Death herself.

Finally, the astral symbolism of the Skanda birth myth is present, in a
veiled form, here as well, for
Rohiņī^{<<chapter5.html_ipg206_fn33>>[[#page_206.html#pg206_fn33][33]]}
is the constellation who is the favourite wife of the moon, and the
constellation ‘Victorious' under which Kṛṣņa is born is at the
meridional of the sky, the point marked by the mountain Kumeru (‘Bad
Meru'), which is the demons' equivalent of the gods' Sumeru (‘Good
Meru'); when the sun is there, in the equinox, the demons are
‘victorious'. Furthermore, it has been suggested that the Six Embryos
may be symbolic of the six months of winter, with Kṛṣņa and Balarāma
representing the first months of spring, an identification which brings
to mind the possible association of the six-headed Skanda with the six
seasons and his birth with the birth of the year.

**** 57. FROM THE /Harivaṃśa/
:PROPERTIES:
:CLASS: calibre16
:END:
[The wicked Kaṃsa, king of the Bhojas and Sātvatas, heard a prophecy
that the eighth child born of his cousin Devakī would kill him. His
first impulse was to kill Devakī, but Devakī's husband, Vasudeva, begged
Kaṃsa to let her live on condition that Vasudeva would deliver to
Kaṃsa every child born of her womb, and Kaṃsa agreed to this.]

Kaṃsa was greatly disturbed, and he reported to his ministers, who
strove always for his welfare, ‘You must all see to it that the
offspring of Devakī are cut off. All of her offspring are to be slain at
the first moment, for a person with harmful intentions must be cut down
at the very root, if there is any doubt. Devakī must be concealed within
the house and guarded secretly; let her wander about, believing herself
to be free, but with my armies placed carefully around her. My women
will count the months beginning with the month of conception, so that we
will know the time that remains before the embryo is fully developed.
Let Vasudeva and his wife be <<chapter5.html_page_207>>guarded
everywhere, day and night, and let there be no carelessness on the part
of the guards, nor let the women and eunuchs talk about our affair. This
is a matter that concerns mere humans, and so it can be accomplished by
us though we are humans. It is known that people like me can overcome
fate;^{<<chapter5.html_ipg207_fn34>>[[#page_207.html#pg207_fn34][34]]}
even fate can be turned to one's advantage by the right combinations of
spells, and by herbal medicines well prescribed, and by constant
effort.' Thus Kaṃsa took precautions to cut off the offspring of
Devakī, for he was warned by Nārada and frightened, and so be began to
hold counsels.

When the heroic Viṣņu heard what Kaṃsa planned to do about the
lying-in chamber, he vanished and began to think: ‘The son of a Bhoja
will kill seven offspring of Devakī, but I will place myself in the
eighth embryo.' As he was thinking in this way, his thoughts went to the
subterranean hell, where six demons named the Six Embryos were lying in
embryonic form. Their valiant forms blazed like the fire that eats the
ambrosia; they were the very image of immortals in battle, for they were
the sons of
Kālanemi.^{<<chapter5.html_ipg207_fn35>>[[#page_207.html#pg207_fn35][35]]}

Once, long ago, these demons had served the Grandfather of the world by
practising keen asceticism, wearing their hair in matted piles on their
heads. Brahmā was pleased with the Six Embryos and offered them a boon,
saying, ‘Tell me what you desire. What boon can I give to each of you?'
All the demons agreed upon their goal, and they said to Brahmā, ‘If you
are pleased with us, hear the boon that we choose. Let us not be slain
by the gods or the great serpents, nor by the restrained supreme sages
armed with curses, nor by Yakṣas or <<chapter5.html_page_208>>lordly
Gandharvas or Siddhas or Cāraņas or men. Let us not be slain, if you
wish to give us a boon, O lord.' Then Brahmā was pleased at heart, and
he said to them, ‘All will take place just as you have declared.' And
having given this boon to the Six Embryos, the self-created one went to
the triple heaven. Then
Hiraņyakaśipu^{<<chapter5.html_ipg208_fn36>>[[#page_208.html#pg208_fn36][36]]}
became angry and said, ‘Since you rejected me when you chose a boon from
the lotus-born god, I will renounce my affection for you and abandon
you, for you have become my enemies. And your
father^{<<chapter5.html_ipg208_fn37>>[[#page_208.html#pg208_fn37][37]]}
who called you the Six Embryos and raised you will kill you all when you
have become embryos. Although you are great demons named the Six
Embryos, you will become the six embryos of Devakī, and Kaṃsa will kill
you when you are within the womb.'

Therefore Viṣņu went to the subterranean watery hell where the demons
were living in the form of six embryos bound together, lying in their
home, the womb of water. He saw the Six Embryos asleep there in the
water, as if hidden in the womb of Sleep who had taken a black form.
Then Viṣņu, whose weapon is truth, entered into their bodies in the
form of a dream and drew out their vital breaths and gave them to Sleep,
saying, ‘Goddess of sleep, go within the house of Devakī, as I command
you, and take these Six Embryos into whom I have infused my vital
breath, and place them one after another in the six embryos in the body
of Devakī. Then, when these offspring have been born and brought to the
house of
Yama,^{<<chapter5.html_ipg208_fn38>>[[#page_208.html#pg208_fn38][38]]}
and Kaṃsa's effort has been fruitless, while Devakī's labour has borne
fruit, then, goddess, I will do a favour for you to make your glory on
earth equal to mine: you will be goddess of the whole world. The seventh
offspring of <<chapter5.html_page_209>>Devakī, my gentle older brother,
this part you will transfer to Rohiņī in the seventh month; and because
the embryo will be drawn out [/saṃkarṣāt/], the young man will be
called
Saṃkarṣaņa,^{<<chapter5.html_ipg209_fn39>>[[#page_209.html#pg209_fn39][39]]}
my older brother with a face like the cool-rayed moon.

‘When I am the eighth embryo in her womb, Kaṃsa will be very careful,
thinking, “Devaki's seventh embryo
miscarried,^{<<chapter5.html_ipg209_fn40>>[[#page_209.html#pg209_fn40][40]]}
because of her fear.” Then you will become the ninth embryo in our
family, born of Yaśodā, the dear wife of Nanda the cow-herd of Kaṃsa,
and you will be born on the ninth day of the dark half of the month. I
will arrive at midnight when the youth of night is gone, at the moment
of the constellation “Victorious”, and I will come out of the womb
painlessly. Then we two will be born together in the eighth month, and
we offspring will be exchanged because of the command of Kaṃsa. I will
go to Yaśodā, and you, goddess, will go to Devakī. And when we two
children have been exchanged, Kaṃsa will be fooled; he will take you by
the foot and throw you down on the stone, and when you have been thrown
down you will obtain an eternal place in the sky. You will be dark like
my own skin, and you will have a face like that of Saṃkarṣaņa; you
will have four stout arms like my arms, in which you will hold a trident
and a sword with a golden handle and a pot full of honey and a flawless
lotus. You will wear a delicate, dark skirt, with a golden bodice, and
on your breast will shine a string of pearls like a mass of moonbeams.
Your ears will be adorned by large celestial earrings, and your shining
face will be the rival of the moon. A triple diadem will bind your
shining hair, and your arms like iron clubs will resound with snakes and
serpents. <<chapter5.html_page_210>>Your high banner will be made of a
peacock's tail, and your shining bracelets and anklets will be made of
peacock's feathers. You will be attended by throngs of grotesque ghosts,
and by my command you will take a vow of eternal virginity and dwell in
the triple heaven. There the hundred-eyed Śakra and the gods will anoint
you and install you in your office by the divine ritual of consecration
that I have appointed for you, and Vāsava will take you for his sister.
As you will be born in the family of Kuśika, you will be called
Kauśikī,^{<<chapter5.html_ipg210_fn41>>[[#page_210.html#pg210_fn41][41]]}
and Indra will give you an eternal dwelling place on the superb mountain
Vindhya, where you will adorn the earth with thousands of
residences.^{<<chapter5.html_ipg210_fn42>>[[#page_210.html#pg210_fn42][42]]}

‘Then you will place me in your heart and destroy the two demons Sumbha
and Nisumbha as they wander with their followers in the mountains.
Wandering over the triple world, restrained by truth, you will assume
any form at will and grant boons generously. With your retinue of ghosts
you will receive an offering of sacrificial beasts on the ninth day of
each month, for you will always be fond of sacrifices of flesh. Mortals
who bow to you when they remember my majesty will receive all that they
desire, children or riches. Men who are lost in dense forests or sunk in
the great ocean or opposed by thieves will have recourse to you. You
will be Perfection, Prosperity, Firmness, Fame, Modesty, Knowledge,
Restraint, Intelligence, Dawn, Night, Light, Sleep, and the Night of
Doomsday. When men worship you you will protect them from capture,
painful slaughter, the death of sons, loss of wealth, and danger of
disease or death. You alone will bewitch Kaṃsa and you will devour the
universe; and for the sake of my own enlargement, I will kill Kaṃsa.'
When the lord had instructed her in this way, he vanished; she bowed to
him and assented and went away.

<<chapter5.html_page_211>>When Devakī, who was like a great divinity,
was impregnated, she received all seven embryos in the way that has been
described. Kaṃsa killed the six embryos as soon as they were born,
smashing them upon the stone ground, but Sleep brought to Rohiņī the
seventh embryo that Devakī had received. At midnight, the pregnant
Rohiņī let her embryo fall from her womb; then she was overcome by
Sleep, and she fell to the ground. As if in a dream, she saw the embryo
slip out of her and when she could not see the embryo inside she became
confused and distressed for a moment. Then Sleep spoke in the dark night
to the terrified Rohiņī, who was as dear to Vasudeva as the
constellation Rohiņī is dear to the
moon.^{<<chapter5.html_ipg211_fn43>>[[#page_211.html#pg211_fn43][43]]}
Sleep said, ‘Since this embryo was drawn out and placed in your womb,
fair lady, he will be your son, named Saṃkarṣaņa.' Rohiņī rejoiced to
receive that son, and she lowered her face and entered the house,
shining like the constellation Rohiņī. Devakī then received another
embryo in the same way, and this was the one for whose sake Kaṃsa had
destroyed the seven other embryos. Kaṃsa's guards guarded that embryo
carefully, but Hari himself, by his own wish, dwelt within that womb.
Now, Yaśodā also received an embryo on that very day, and that embryo
was Sleep herself, the servant of Viṣņu, born of the body of Viṣņu.

When the time of the pregnancy was still incomplete, after eight months,
the two women, Devakī and Yaśodā, brought forth children together. On
the night when the lord Kṛṣņa was born to Devakī, wife of Vasudeva, in
the family of the Vṛṣņis, on that same night Yaśodā, wife of the
cow-herd <<chapter5.html_page_212>>Nanda, brought forth a daughter.
Yaśodā and Devakī had become pregnant at the same time, and so when
Devakī gave birth to Viṣņu, Yaśodā gave birth to a daughter. At that
moment, in the very middle of the night, when the moon was in
‘Victorious', the oceans shook and the mountains trembled, and fires
blazed peacefully, when the Exciter of Men was born. Gentle winds blew,
and the dust lay undisturbed, and the stars shone brightly, when the
Exciter was born. Drums which had not been struck resounded in the
heaven of the gods, and the lord of the triple heaven sent down a rain
of flowers from the sky. The great sages and Gandharvas and celestial
nymphs approached the Chastiser of Madhu and praised him with auspicious
and sacred words.

Then Vasudeva took up the little boy immediately, for he was frightened
and full of tenderness toward his son, and he brought him to the house
of Yaśodā. He gave the little boy, unrecognized, to Yaśodā and took her
little girl and placed her on Devakī's bed. When the two children had
been exchanged, Vasudeva was terrified, but he had done what he had to
do. Then he went out of the house and reported to Kaṃsa, the son of
Ugrasena, that a daughter of fair complexion had been born. When the
mighty Kaṃsa heard this he hastened immediately with his guards and
came to the door of Vasudeva's house, and at the door he said with
brusque and menacing words, ‘What has been born? Give it to me
instantly!' Then all the women around Devakī cried out in alarm, and
Devakī, stammering in her tears, said to Kaṃsa, ‘A little girl has been
born. My lord, you have killed my seven fine infant boys; this little
daughter is already as good as dead. Look, if you don't believe me.'
When Kaṃsa saw the girl he rejoiced and said, twisting her words with
wicked intent, ‘A daughter is indeed dead when she is born.' The infant
girl was lying exhausted upon the bed of childbirth, her hair still
moist from the water of the womb. Kaṃsa placed her on the ground
<<chapter5.html_page_213>>before him, and the man took her by the foot
and whirled her around vigorously and dashed her violently to the stone
floor.

When she had been hurled down upon the stone floor, she flew up to
heaven, unbruised, leaving behind the body of the infant. She entered
the sky, wearing heavenly garlands and unguents, her hair loosened. She
became an eternal, divine maiden, praised by the gods, four-armed. She
wore dark blue and golden garments, and her breasts were like the
swelling temples of elephants, her hips as broad as chariots, her face
like the moon. Her complexion was like a flash of lightning; her eyes
were like young suns; with her full breasts and her voice like
thundering clouds, she was like a cloudy
sunset.^{<<chapter5.html_ipg213_fn44>>[[#page_213.html#pg213_fn44][44]]}
When the night was swallowed by darkness and swarmed with bands of
ghosts, she danced and laughed and shone against the darkness. This
dreadful female in the sky drank from an enormous cup and laughed a
great laugh and spoke in fury to Kaṃsa: ‘Kaṃsa, Kaṃsa, since you
attacked me to destroy me, hurling me down upon the stone, therefore at
your death, when you are overpowered by your enemy, I will smash your
body with my own hands and drink your warm blood.' When she had uttered
this gruesome speech, the goddess wandered away with her bands of
attendants, wandering wherever she pleased through the sky, the dwelling
place of the gods.

When she had gone, Kaṃsa realized that she was his own death.

*** /Four episodes from the Bhāgavata Purāṇa/
:PROPERTIES:
:CLASS: calibre11
:END:
The Kṛṣņa of the /Bhāgavata Purāņa/ is a cow-herd (/gopa/), and the
Vedic cow imagery is given a new dimension in this text: where the cows
of Indra and Saramā were symbolic of wealth and battle spoils, and
<<chapter5.html_page_214>>the cows of the Brāhmaņas were sacrificial
animals, the cows of the /Bhāgavata Purāņa/ are distinctly /not/ to be
killed -- they are symbolic of maternal love (/vātsalya/, literally
‘calf love'), the spirit of devotion which the worshipper should feel
toward Kṛṣņa, just as the cowherd women (/gopīs/) express through
their erotic love for Kṛṣņa another facet of this devotion.

*/Infancy: Kṛṣņa kills the ogress Pūtanā/*

The mythology of Kṛṣņa the baby, like the myth of Viṣņu the dwarf,
plays constantly upon the contrast between appearance and reality -- the
apparently tiny mortal (the dwarf, the infant, the individual soul)
which occasionally reveals its true nature as the infinite immortal (the
giant, the god, the universal godhead). Images of concealment abound in
descriptions of the god: the sword in the sheath, the spark in ashes. A
parallel masquerade takes place in the forces of evil, the hideous,
putrid ogress disguised as a charming woman, the virulent poison which
appears to be nourishing milk. The ambivalence of milk -- poison is a
central motif of Hindu mythology; the sweet milk of the Paņis drugs
Saramā, and Skanda's wet-nurse is the goddess of death, while the gods
who churn the ocean of milk in order to obtain ambrosia also obtain
poison.^{<<chapter5.html_ipg214_fn45>>[[#page_214.html#pg214_fn45][45]]}
In the present myth, this reversal (poison substituting for milk in
Pūtanā's breasts) is reversed yet again, for the babe uses the act of
sucking to kill /her/ as she intended to kill him; and, finally, this
reversal is in turn reversed, for it is said that by killing her when
drinking her milk he purified her and made her sweet-smelling -- i.e. he
made the virtue which she had falsely assumed become real. As the
present episode begins, Nanda has been to see Vasudeva and has been
warned that Kṛṣņa might be in danger.

When Nanda heard the speech of Vasudeva he thought, as he went on the
road homewards, that this could not be false, and he sought refuge with
Hari, for he feared some misfortune.

The horrible Pūtanā (‘Stinking'), a devourer of children,
<<chapter5.html_page_215>>was sent by Kaṃsa. She wandered through
cities, villages, and pastures, killing infants. Wherever men do not
recite the deeds of Kṛṣņa the Lord of the Sātvatas, a recitation which
destroys Rākṣasas, there evil demons work their sorcery. One day Pūtanā
came to Nanda's village, wandering at will, flying through the
sky,^{<<chapter5.html_ipg215_fn46>>[[#page_215.html#pg215_fn46][46]]}
and by her magic powers she assumed the form of a beautiful woman.
Jasmine was bound into her hair; her hips and breasts were full, her
waist slender. She wore fine garments, and her face was framed by hair
that shone with the lustre from her shimmering, quivering earrings. She
cast sidelong glances and smiled sweetly, and she carried a lotus in her
hand. When the wives of the cow-herds saw the woman, who stole their
hearts, they thought that she must be
Śrī^{<<chapter5.html_ipg215_fn47>>[[#page_215.html#pg215_fn47][47]]}
incarnate, come to see her husband. The infant-swallower, searching for
children, happened to come to the house of Nanda, and she saw there on
the bed the infant Kṛṣņa, whose true energy was concealed, like a fire
covered with ashes. Though he kept his eyes closed, he who is the very
soul of all that moves and all that is still knew her to be an ogress
who killed children, and she took the infinite one onto her lap, as one
might pick up a sleeping deadly viper, mistaking it for a rope. Seeing
her, whose wicked heart was concealed by sweet actions like a sharp
sword encased in a scabbard, his mother was overcome by her splendour,
and, thinking her to be a good woman, stood looking on.

Then the horrible one, taking him on her lap, gave the baby her breast,
which had been smeared with a virulent poison. But the lord, pressing
her breast hard with his hands, angrily drank out her life's breath with
the milk. She cried out, <<chapter5.html_page_216>>‘Let go! Let go!
Enough!' as she was squeezed in all her vital parts. She rolled her eyes
and thrashed her arms and legs and screamed again and again, and all her
limbs were bathed in sweat. At the sound of her deep roar, the earth
with its mountains and the sky with its planets shook; the subterranean
waters and the regions of the sky resounded, and people fell to the
ground fearing that lightning had struck. The night-wandering ogress,
with agonizing pain in her breasts, opened her mouth, stretched out her
arms and legs, tore her hair, and fell lifeless on the ground in the
cow-pen, like the serpent Vṛtra struck down by Indra's thunderbolt.
Then she resumed her true form, and as her body fell it crushed all the
trees for twelve miles around; this was a great marvel. Her mouth was
full of terrible teeth as large as plough-shafts; her nostrils were like
mountain caves; her breasts were like boulders, and her hideous red hair
was strewn about. Her eyes were like deep, dark wells; her buttocks were
terrifying, large as beaches; her stomach was like a great dry lake
emptied of water, her arms like dams. When the cow-herds and their wives
saw her corpse they were terrified, and their hearts, ears, and skulls
had already been split by her terrible roar.

When they saw the little boy playing on her breast fearlessly, the wives
of the cow-herds were frightened and quickly took him away, and Yaśodā
and Rohiņī and the others protected the boy by waving a cow's tail on
him and performing similar rites. They bathed the baby in cow's urine
and cow-dust, and with cow-dung they wrote the names of Viṣņu on his
twelve limbs, to protect him...
^{<<chapter5.html_ipg216_fn48>>[[#page_216.html#pg216_fn48][48]]} Thus
the loving wives of the cow-herds protected him, and then his mother
gave her son her breast to suck and put him to bed.

Meanwhile, Nanda and the other cow-herds returned to the village from
Mathurā, and when they saw the body of <<chapter5.html_page_217>>Pūtanā
they were astonished. ‘Indeed,
Anakadundubhi^{<<chapter5.html_ipg217_fn49>>[[#page_217.html#pg217_fn49][49]]}
has become a seer or a master of yoga,' they said, ‘for he foresaw and
foretold this whole calamity.' Then the villagers cut up the corpse with
axes and threw the limbs far away, and they surrounded them with wood
and burnt them. The smoke that arose from Pūtanā's body as it burnt was
as sweet-smelling as aloe-wood, for her sins had been destroyed when she
fed Kṛṣņa. Pūtanā, a slayer of people and infants, a female Rākṣasa,
a drinker of blood, reached the heaven of good people because she had
given her breast to Viṣņu -- even though she did it because she wished
to kill him. How much greater, then, is the reward of those who offer
what is dearest to the highest Soul, Kṛṣņa, with faith and devotion,
like his doting mothers? She gave her breast to Kṛṣņa to suck, and he
touched her body with his two feet which remain in the hearts of his
devotees and which are adored by those who are adored by the world, and
so, though an evil sorceress, she obtained the heaven which is the
reward of mothers. What then is the reward of those cows and mothers
whose breasts' milk Kṛṣņa drank? The lord, son of Devakī, giver of
beatitude and all else, drank their milk as their breasts flowed because
of their love for their son. Since they always looked upon Kṛṣņa as
their son, they will never again be doomed to rebirth that arises from
ignorance.

When the inhabitants of the village smelled the sweet smoke from the
pyre they asked, ‘What is this? What has caused it?', and they returned
to the village. There they heard the cowherds describe the arrival of
Pūtanā and the subsequent events, and when they learned of the death of
Pūtanā and the safety of the baby, they were amazed. The noble Nanda
lovingly took his son on his lap like one who had returned from the
<<chapter5.html_page_218>>dead, and kissed his head and rejoiced.
Whatever mortal faithfully hears this tale of the marvellous deed of the
baby Kṛṣņa, the liberation of Pūtanā, he finds his joy in Govinda.

*/Childhood: Kṛṣņa's mother looks inside his mouth/*

The motif of concealment, of the big inside the little, of banal detail
obscuring sacred majesty, assumes more metaphysical dimensions in the
episode of Kṛṣņa's open mouth, a motif based upon a much earlier myth
from the /Mahābhārata/: the sage Mārkaņḍeya was floating in the cosmic
ocean after the dissolution of the universe, when he came upon a young
boy sleeping under a banyan tree. He entered the mouth of the boy -- who
was Viṣņu -- and saw within him the entire universe, whereupon he came
back out of Viṣņu's
mouth.^{<<chapter5.html_ipg218_fn50>>[[#page_218.html#pg218_fn50][50]]}
Through this link, the story of Kṛṣņa and Yaśodā may be seen as part
of the corpus of myths of rebirth through being
swallowed.^{<<chapter5.html_ipg218_fn51>>[[#page_218.html#pg218_fn51][51]]}
Another masquerade typical of the /Bhāgavata Purāņa/ is the description
of Kṛṣņa's mischief: he pretends to be a good boy but does naughty
things; yet his naughtiness is a source of pleasure to his mother, just
as the apparent evils wrought by the gods -- death, heresy, all the
oppositional
pairs^{<<chapter5.html_ipg218_fn52>>[[#page_218.html#pg218_fn52][52]]}
-- are ultimately conducive to our welfare.

After a little while,
Rāma^{<<chapter5.html_ipg218_fn53>>[[#page_218.html#pg218_fn53][53]]}
and Keśava began to play in the village, crawling on their hands and
knees. They slithered about quickly, dragging their feet in the muddy
pastures, delighting in the tinkling
sound.^{<<chapter5.html_ipg218_fn54>>[[#page_218.html#pg218_fn54][54]]}
They would follow someone <<chapter5.html_page_219>>and then, suddenly
bewildered and frightened, they would hasten back to their mothers.
Their mothers' breasts would flow with milk out of tenderness for their
own sons, whose bodies were beautifully covered with mud, and they would
embrace them in their arms and give them their breasts to suck, and as
they gazed at the faces with their innocent smiles and tiny teeth they
would rejoice. Then the children began to play in the village at those
boyish games that women love to see. They would grab hold of the tails
of calves and be dragged back and forth in the pasture, and the women
would look at them and forget their housework and laugh merrily. But the
mothers, trying to keep the two very active and playful little boys from
horned animals, fire, animals with teeth and tusks, and knives, water,
birds, and thorns, were unable to do their housework, and they were
rather uneasy.

After a little while, Rāma and Kṛṣņa stopped crawling on their hands
and knees and began to walk about the pastures quickly on their feet.
Then the lord Kṛṣņa began to play with Rāma and with the village boys
of their age, giving great pleasure to the village women. When the wives
of the cowherds saw the charming boyish pranks of Kṛṣņa, they would go
in a group to tell his mother, saying, ‘Kṛṣņa unties the calves when
it is not the proper time, and he laughs at everyone's angry shouts. He
devises ways to steal and eat curds and milk and thinks food sweet only
if he steals it. He distributes the food among the monkeys; if he
doesn't eat the food, he breaks the pot. If he cannot find anything, he
becomes angry at the house and makes the children cry before he runs
away. If something is beyond his reach, he fashions some expedient by
piling up pillows, mortars, and so on; or if he knows that the milk and
curds have been placed in pots suspended in netting, he makes holes in
the pots. When the wives of the cow-herds are busy with household
duties, he will steal things in a dark room, making his own body with
its masses of jewels <<chapter5.html_page_220>>serve as a lamp. This is
the sort of impudent act which he commits; and he pees and so forth in
clean houses. These are the thieving tricks that he contrives, but he
behaves in the opposite way and is good when you are near.' When his
mother heard this report from the women who were looking at Kṛṣņa's
frightened eyes and beautiful face, she laughed and did not wish to
scold him.

One day when Rāma and the other little sons of the cowherds were
playing, they reported to his mother, ‘Kṛṣņa has eaten dirt.' Yaśodā
took Kṛṣņa by the hand and scolded him, for his own good, and she said
to him, seeing that his eyes were bewildered with fear, ‘Naughty boy,
why have you secretly eaten dirt? These boys, your friends, and your
elder brother say so.' Kṛṣņa said, ‘Mother, I have not eaten. They are
all lying. If you think they speak the truth, look at my mouth
yourself.' ‘If that is the case, then open your mouth,' she said to the
lord Hari, the god of unchallenged sovereignty who had in sport taken
the form of a human child, and he opened his mouth.

She then saw in his mouth the whole eternal universe, and heaven, and
the regions of the sky, and the orb of the earth with its mountains,
islands, and oceans; she saw the wind, and lightning, and the moon and
stars, and the zodiac; and water and fire and air and space itself; she
saw the vacillating senses, the mind, the elements, and the three
strands of matter. She saw within the body of her son, in his gaping
mouth, the whole universe in all its variety, with all the forms of life
and time and nature and action and hopes, and her own village, and
herself. Then she became afraid and confused, thinking, ‘Is this a dream
or an illusion wrought by a god? Or is it a delusion of my own
perception? Or is it some portent of the natural powers of this little
boy, my son? I bow down to the feet of the god, whose nature cannot be
imagined or grasped by mind, heart, acts, or speech; he in whom all of
this universe <<chapter5.html_page_221>>is inherent, impossible to
fathom. The god is my refuge, he through whose power of delusion there
arise in me such false beliefs as “I”, “This is my husband”, “This is my
son”, “I am the wife of the village chieftain and all his wealth is
mine, including these cow-herds and their wives and their wealth of
cattle.” '

When the cow-herd's wife had come to understand the true essence in this
way, the lord spread his magic illusion in the form of maternal
affection. Instantly the cow-herd's wife lost her memory of what had
occurred and took her son on her lap. She was as she had been before,
her heart flooded with even greater love. She considered Hari -- whose
greatness is extolled by the three Vedas and the Upanişads and the
philosophies of Sāṅkhya and yoga and all the Sātvata texts -- she
considered him to be her son.

*/Adolescence: Kṛṣņa subdues the serpent Kāliya/*

The story of Kṛṣņa and Kāliya further expands the contrast between
poison and ambrosia: the snake poisons the pool, while Kṛṣņa makes its
water ‘like ambrosia' by churning it with his feet, just as the gods
churn the ocean to obtain ambrosia and poison (and the ocean is the
final resting-place for Kāliya, as it is for all other destructive
forces). The snake has poison in his gaze, while Kṛṣņa has ambrosia in
his. Kāliya is the enemy of the Garuḍa bird, for snakes are symbolic of
death, poison, and the underworld, while birds are symbolic of birth
(the egg being a visible symbol of the world-egg, the golden egg in the
cosmic waters), ambrosia (for the bird carries seed or Soma in his
beak),^{<<chapter5.html_ipg221_fn55>>[[#page_221.html#pg221_fn55][55]]}
and heaven. Viṣņu combines these symbols within himself, for he sleeps
on the serpent of eternity (Ananta or Śeṣa -- the good /alter ego/ of
the evil Kāliya) and then awakens to ride on the Garuḍa bird; but in
this myth he is a dragon-killer, slaying Kāliya as Indra slays Vṛtra,
purifying the pool as Indra releases the trapped waters.

At the beginning of each month, all the serpents used to receive an
offering under a tree, to prevent unpleasantness; this was agreed long
ago by the people in the realm of the snakes. And each of the serpents,
to protect himself, would give a portion of this offering to the noble
Suparņa^{<<chapter5.html_ipg222_fn56>>[[#page_222.html#pg222_fn56][56]]}
at the beginning of each lunar fortnight. But Kāliya, the son of
Kadrū,^{<<chapter5.html_ipg222_fn57>>[[#page_222.html#pg222_fn57][57]]}
was full of pride because of the virulence of his poison, and he
disregarded Garuḍa and himself ate that offering. When the lord Garuḍa
who is loved by the lord Viṣņu learned of this he became angry and flew
swiftly after Kāliya to kill him; and when the serpent, whose weapons
were poison and fangs, saw him approaching swiftly he raised his many
heads with their hideous tongues and hisses and fierce eyes and began to
bite Suparņa with his fangs. But Garuḍa the son of Tārkṣya, the mount
of the Chastiser of Madhu, became furious and swooped down upon him with
a fierce attack and a great blast of speed, and struck the son of Kadrū
with his left wing, which shone like gold. When Kāliya was struck by the
wing of Suparņa he was greatly afflicted, and he entered a pool in the
river Kālindī which Garuḍa could not enter or reach.

For in that very place Garuḍa had once eaten a fish that he wanted;
even though the sage Saubhari had forbidden him to
<<chapter5.html_page_223>>eat it, Garuḍa was so hungry that he ate it
by force. And when Saubhari saw the poor fishes so miserable, their lord
having been slain, he was overcome with pity and wished to protect and
preserve the creatures there. ‘If Garuḍa enters here to eat the
fishes,' he said, ‘he will immediately part with his life's breath; this
I swear.' Kāliya knew of this, but no other serpent knew it; and so,
because he feared Garuḍa, he dwelt there, until he was expelled by
Kṛṣņa...

One day as the lord Kṛṣņa was wandering about in Vṛņḍāvana without
Rāma, he went with his friends to the river Kālindī. The cows and
cow-herds were oppressed by the heat of summer and suffering from
thirst, and they drank the polluted and poisoned water of the river.
Their wits were overwhelmed by fate so that they touched that poisoned
water, and they all fell lifeless on the bank. When Kṛṣņa, the lord of
the lords of yoga, saw them in that condition, he revived his followers
with a glance that rained ambrosia. They arose from the bank, their
memories restored, and they looked at one another in amazement as they
realized that their revival from death after drinking poison had been
brought about by the favour of a glance from Govinda...

There was a certain pool in the Kālindī into whose waters, which boiled
with the fire of Kāliya's poison, fell birds which were passing overhead
and struck by blasts of air laden with drops from its poisonous waves;
and breathing creatures, moving and still, who came to its banks died.
When Kṛṣņa, who had become incarnate to restrain the wicked, perceived
that the river had been polluted by that serpent whose poison was so
virulent and swiftly active, he climbed a very high Kadamba tree,
clapped his hands, girded his loins tightly, and plunged into the
poisoned water. The mass of water in that pool of serpents was swelled
by the poison emitted by serpents who were shaken by the blast caused by
the vigorous dive of the Man, and it overflowed for a hundred
bow-lengths on all <<chapter5.html_page_224>>sides with terrible waves
tawny with poison, but this was nothing to him of infinite might.

When Kāliya heard the noise of the whirling of the club-like arms of
Kṛṣņa, who was playing in the pool like a rogue elephant, and saw his
own residence overwhelmed, he was unable to bear the sight and sound,
and he slithered out. He enveloped angrily with his coils and bit in his
vital spots that boy whose feet were like the inside of a lotus, who was
bright as a cloud, beautiful to see in his youth, adorned with the
Śrīvatsa, wearing yellow garments, with a beautiful smile on his face,
playing fearlessly. When Kṛṣņa's dear friends the cattle-tenders saw
him caught up in the coils of the serpent, apparently motionless, they
were greatly distressed; since they had consigned themselves, their
friends, their wealth, their families, and all their desires to Kṛṣņa,
their minds were stupefied with grief, sorrow, and fear, and they fell
down. The cows and bulls and calves lowed in their misery; gazing at
Kṛṣņa in fear, they stood and seemed to weep.

Then there appeared in the village three kinds of violent great portent
boding danger nearby: there were calamities on earth, in heaven, and in
the body. When Nanda and the other cow-herds noted them they were
terrified, knowing that Kṛṣņa had gone to tend the cows without Rāma.
Not knowing who he really was, they thought that his death had come,
because of the evil portents; and since he was their very life's breath,
and their hearts were set upon him, they were tortured by grief, sorrow,
and fear. All the cow-herds, the young, the old, and the women, went
miserably out of the village, hoping to see Kṛṣņa. When the lord Bala
saw them so discouraged he laughed, but he did not say a word, for he
knew the powers of his younger brother.

As they searched for their beloved Kṛṣņa by following the path
indicated by the footprints with the signs of the lord, they all came to
the banks of the Yamunā. Hastening along on
<<chapter5.html_page_225>>the path, they distinguished between the
footprints of the cows and the footprints of the lord of all, for these
were marked by the lotus, barley shoot, elephant goad, thunderbolt, and
banner. When from a distance they saw Kṛṣņa in the pool, the watery
abode, wrapped in the serpent's coils, and they saw the cow-herds
stupefied and the cattle scattered and lowing, they became deeply
alarmed and unhappy. The hearts of the cow-herds' wives were
passionately devoted to the infinite lord, and they remembered his
friendship, his smiles and glances and words; and when their dearest one
was swallowed by the serpent they were burnt by great sorrow and saw the
triple world as empty, for it was devoid of their beloved. They went to
Kṛṣņa's mother, who was sorrowing for her child, and they sympathized
with her and wept, for they shared their grief, and they told their
favourite village stories, and fixed their gazes upon Kṛṣņa's face and
seemed as if dead. When the lord Rāma, who knew the true majesty of
Kṛṣņa, saw that Nanda and the others, whose very life's breath was
Kṛṣņa, were about to enter the pool, he prevented them.

Kṛṣņa, seeing that his own village, with its women and children, was
so miserable because of him, and knowing that it had no refuge other
than him, conformed to the way of mortals and, staying for a moment,
rose up from the serpent's grip. The serpent's hoods were tortured by
the expanding body of Kṛṣņa, and he released him; he raised his hoods
angrily and stood spitting venom through his hissing nostrils; he stared
at Hari with his unblinking eyes that were like frying pans, and he
licked the two corners of his mouth with his forked tongue, and his very
gaze was full of the fire of a virulent poison. Playfully, Kṛṣņa
circled about him, like Garuḍa, the lord of birds, and Kāliya also
moved about, watching for an opportunity. When the serpent's strength
was exhausted by moving about in this way, the First bent down the
snake's raised shoulder and mounted upon his broad heads.
<<chapter5.html_page_226>>Then the master of all musical arts danced,
his lotus feet made bright red by their contact with the multitude of
jewels on the serpent's
head.^{<<chapter5.html_ipg226_fn58>>[[#page_226.html#pg226_fn58][58]]}
When the wives of the Gandharvas, Siddhas, divine Cāraņas, and gods saw
that he was preparing to dance, they approached him joyfully with
offerings of Mṛdaṅga, Paņava, and Anaka drums, and musical
instruments, and songs and flowers and praise.

He who bears a cruel rod of punishment trampled with his feet whatever
head of the hundred-headed one was yet unbent, and the serpent, his
life-span spent but still writhing, vomited clotted blood from his mouth
and fell, suffering horribly. The Ancient Man danced on the serpent who
still spewed poison from his eyes and hissed loudly in his anger, and he
trampled down with his feet whatever head the serpent raised, subduing
him as calmly as if he were being worshipped with flowers. Kāliya, his
umbrella of hoods shattered by the gay dance of death, his limbs broken,
vomiting blood copiously from his mouths, remembered the guru of all who
move and are still, the Ancient Man, Nārāyaņa, and he surrendered to him
in his heart.

When Kāliya's wives saw that the serpent was sinking down under the
burden of Kṛṣņa who is the very womb of the universe, and that his
umbrella of hoods was crushed by the blows of Kṛṣņa's heels, then they
were distressed, and their garments, ornaments, and hair-bindings became
loose, and they sought refuge with the Primary One. Their hearts aching,
the good women placed their children in front of them, prostrated their
bodies on the ground, folded their palms together, bowed to the lord of
creatures and sought refuge with him who gives refuge, for they wished
to save their husband from harm and release him from sin.

The serpent's wives said, ‘Your punishment of this man who has sinned is
proper, for you became incarnate to restrain
<<chapter5.html_page_227>>the wicked. Viewing with an indifferent gaze
your enemy or your own sons, considering only the fruit of actions, you
mete out punishment. You have favoured us, for your punishment of the
wicked removes their impurity. Even your anger should be considered an
act of grace, because our husband is embodied as a venomous
reptile^{<<chapter5.html_ipg227_fn59>>[[#page_227.html#pg227_fn59][59]]}...
You should endure the offence committed by our husband, committed by
your own creature. As you have a peaceful soul, you should forgive the
fool who did not know you. Lord, be gracious; the serpent is giving up
his life's breaths. Grant life's breath to our husband, for we are women
for whom good people will sorrow. Command us, your servants, for one who
obeys your commands with faith is released from all danger.'

When the lord was thus praised by the wives of the serpent, he released
the unconscious Kāliya whose head had been smashed by the pounding of
his feet. The wretched Kāliya gradually regained his senses and his
life's breath, and breathing with difficulty he folded his palms
together and said to Hari, Kṛṣņa, ‘We are evil from our birth, dark
creatures whose anger endures. O lord, one's own nature is difficult to
abandon, for it possesses people like an evil demon. Creator, this whole
universe was created by you out of the three strands, with various
natures, powers, strengths, sources, seeds, hopes, and forms. And in it
are we, O lord, serpents whose anger is far-reaching from birth. How can
we ourselves, deluded creatures, abandon your delusion which is hard to
abandon? You are the cause of this, omniscient one, lord of the
universe; ordain for us grace or punishment, as you think best.'

Then the lord, who had taken human form, answered, ‘You must not stay
here, serpent; go quickly to the ocean with your abundant kinsmen,
children, and wives. Let this river be enjoyed by cows and men. Whatever
mortal remembers my <<chapter5.html_page_228>>chastisement of you and
recites it at dawn and sunset, he will have no fear of you. And whoever
bathes in this pool where I have played and offers its waters to the
gods and others, and fasts and remembers me and worships me, he will be
released from all sins. Leave this pool and take shelter in the island
Ramaņaka. Suparņa, whom you feared, will not eat you now that you have
been marked by my foot.' When Kāliya heard the words of the lord Kṛṣņa
whose deeds are marvellous, he worshipped him in joy and ceremony, with
his wives. He worshipped the lord of the universe, whose banner bears
the Garuḍa, and propitiated him with excellent celestial garments,
garlands, and jewels, with rich ornaments and with celestial perfumes
and unguents, and with a great garland of lotuses; and he walked around
him in reverence and bowed to him and happily received permission to
leave. Then, with his wives, friends, and sons he went to the island in
the ocean, and at that moment the Yamunā became free from poison, its
water like ambrosia, by the grace of the lord who had taken human form
for his sport.

*/Manhood: Kṛṣņa steals the clothes of the girls of the village/*

In the battle with Kāliya, the concept of the devotee longing for god is
expressed through the image of three groups of women bereft of their
protectors -- the fish-women whose lord is killed, the wives of Kāliya,
and the cow-herd women who long for the child Kṛṣņa. This image is
further developed in later chapters, where Kṛṣņa dances erotically in
the moonlight with the cow-herd women (just as he danced the dance of
death on Kāliya), only to vanish from their midst.

In another episode of this cycle, the stealing of the girls' clothes,
the childish pranks of the little Kṛṣņa are replaced by a well-worn
bit of erotic strategy, yet the metaphysical overtones of this mischief
are profound; by forcing the girls to reveal their nakedness, he forces
them into a direct encounter with their god, and although the mortal
Kṛṣņa tricks them into clasping their hands over their heads so that
<<chapter5.html_page_229>>he can get a full view of their bodies, the
immortal Kṛṣņa thus places them in an attitude of reverent devotion
before him.

In the first month of winter, the girls of Nanda's village performed a
certain vow to the goddess Kātyāyanī. They ate rice cooked with
clarified butter; they bathed in the water of the Kālindī river at
sunrise; they made an image of the goddess out of sand and worshipped it
with fragrant perfumes and garlands, with offerings and incense and
lamps, and with bouquets of flowers, fresh sprigs of leaves, fruits, and
rice. And they prayed: ‘Goddess Kātyāyanī, great mistress of yoga,
empress of great deluding magic, make the son of the cow-herd Nanda my
husband. I bow to you.' Saying this prayer, the girls would worship her,
and having set their hearts on Kṛṣņa, the girls performed this vow for
a month; they worshipped Bhadrakālī so that the son of Nanda would be
their husband. Arising at dawn, calling one another by name, they would
join hands and go to bathe in the Kālindī every day, singing loudly
about Kṛṣņa as they went.

One day, when they had gone to the river and taken off their clothes on
the bank as usual, they were playing joyfully in the water, singing
about Kṛṣņa. The lord Kṛṣņa, lord of all masters of yoga, came there
with his friends of the same age in order to grant them the object of
their rites. He took their clothes and quickly climbed a Nīpa tree, and
laughing with the laughing boys he told what the joke was: ‘Girls, let
each one of you come here and take her own clothes as she wishes. I
promise you, this is no jest, for you have been exhausted by your vows.
I have never before told an untruth, and these boys know this.
Slender-waisted ones, come one by one or all together and take your
clothes.' When the cow-herd girls saw what his game was, they were
overwhelmed with love, but they looked at one another in shame, and they
smiled, but <<chapter5.html_page_230>>they did not come out. Flustered
and embarrassed by Govinda's words and by his jest, they sank down up to
their necks in the icy water, and, shivering, they said to him, ‘You
should not have played such a wicked trick. We know you as our beloved,
son of the cow-herd Nanda, the pride of the village. Give us our
clothes, for we are trembling. O darkly handsome one, we are your slaves
and will do as you command, but you know /dharma/: give us our clothes
or we will tell your father, the chieftain.'

The lord said to them, ‘If you are my slaves and will do as I command,
then come here and take back your clothes, O brightly smiling ones.'
Then all the girls, shivering and smarting with cold, came out of the
water, covering their crotches with their hands. The lord was pleased
and gratified by their chaste actions, and he looked at them and placed
their clothes on his shoulder and smiled and said, ‘Since you swam in
the water without clothes while you were under a vow, this was an insult
to the
divinity.^{<<chapter5.html_ipg230_fn60>>[[#page_230.html#pg230_fn60][60]]}
Therefore you must fold your hands and place them on your heads and bow
low in expiation of your sin, and then you may take your clothes.' When
the village girls heard what the infallible one said, they thought that
bathing naked had been a violation of their vows, and they bowed down to
Kṛṣņa, the very embodiment of all their rituals, who had thus
fulfilled their desires and wiped out their disgrace and sin. Then the
lord, the son of Devakī, gave their clothes to them, for he felt pity
when he saw them bowed down in this way and he was satisfied with them.

Though they were greatly deceived and robbed of their modesty, though
they were mocked and treated like toys and stripped of their clothes,
yet they held no grudge against him, for they were happy to be together
with their beloved. Rejoicing <<chapter5.html_page_231>>in the closeness
of their lover, they put on their clothes; their bashful glances, in the
thrall of their hearts, did not move from him. Knowing that the girls
had taken a vow because they desired to touch his feet, the lord with a
rope around his waist said to the girls, ‘Good ladies, I know that your
desire is to worship me. I rejoice in this vow, which deserves to be
fulfilled. The desire of those whose hearts have been placed in me does
not give rise to further desire, just as seed corn that has been boiled
or fried does not give rise to seed. You have achieved your aim. Now,
girls, go back to the village and you will enjoy your nights with me,
for it was for this that you fine ladies undertook your vow and
worship.' When the girls heard this from Kṛṣņa, they had obtained what
they desired; and, meditating upon his lotus feet, they forced
themselves to go away from him to the village.

*** The Purāņic avatars of Viṣņu

*VIṢṆU BECOMES THE BUDDHA TO DELUDE THE DEMONS*

The Buddha avatar is not, as it might seem at first glance, a true
attempt to assimilate the teachings of the Buddha into Hinduism (though
this was certainly done in many other ways); on the contrary, although
it is Viṣņu who expresses (most cogently) the anti-Vedic sentiments
attributed by Hindus to Buddhists, Jains, Materialists, and other
heretics, he does this in order to destroy the demons with an /evil/
doctrine -- Buddhism -- on the principle that one cannot destroy a
virtuous person unless one corrupts him first. That mankind is also
converted to Buddhism (and Jainism) is merely an unfortunate by-product
of Viṣņu's act, in the Hindu view; and the fact that the doctrine is
directed to the demons indicates the fanatic degree of anti-Buddhist
sentiment that motivated the author of this myth.

**** <<chapter5.html_page_232>><<chapter5.html_myt62>>62. FROM THE /Viṣņu Purāņa/
:PROPERTIES:
:CLASS: calibre16
:END:
There was once a battle between the gods and the demons that lasted for
a hundred celestial years, in which the gods were conquered by the
demons commanded by Hrāda. The gods went to the northern shore of the
ocean of milk and practised asceticism in order to propitiate Viṣņu,
and they sang a hymn of praise to him... When they had finished praising
him, the gods saw the supreme lord Hari mounted on the Garuḍa bird,
with his conch and discus and mace in his hands. All the gods prostrated
themselves before him and said, ‘Have mercy, lord; protect us from the
demons, as we have come for refuge. The demons under the command of
Hrāda have stolen away our portions of the sacrifices in the triple
world, but they have not violated the command of Brahmā, O supreme lord.
Even though we and they are both born of portions of you, who are the
essence of all creatures, nevertheless we see the universe as divided, a
distinction caused by ignorance. They take pleasure in the duties of
their own class, and they follow the path of the Vedas and are full of
ascetic powers. Therefore we cannot kill them, although they are our
enemies, and so you should devise some means by which we will be able to
kill the demons, O lord, soul of everything without exception.'

When the lord Viṣņu heard their request, he emitted from his body a
deluding form of his magic power of
illusion,^{<<chapter5.html_ipg232_fn61>>[[#page_232.html#pg232_fn61][61]]}
and he gave it to the supreme gods and said, ‘This magic deluder will
bewitch all the demons so that they will be excluded from the path of
the Vedas, and thus they will be susceptible to slaughter. For no matter
how many gods, demons, or others obstruct the way of the authority of
Brahmā, I will slaughter them all in order to establish order. Therefore
go <<chapter5.html_page_233>>away and do not fear; this magic deluder
will go before you today and assist you, gods.' When the gods heard this
they prostrated themselves before him and went back whence they had
come, and the magic deluder went with the great gods to the place where
the great demons were.

When the magic deluder, naked, bald, carrying a bunch of peacock
feathers,^{<<chapter5.html_ipg233_fn62>>[[#page_233.html#pg233_fn62][62]]}
saw that the great demons had gone to the banks of the Narmadā river and
were practising asceticism, he spoke to the demons with smooth words,
saying, ‘Lord of demons! Tell me why you are practising asceticism -- do
you wish for the fruits of asceticism in this world or in the world
beyond?' The demons replied, ‘Noble one, we have undertaken this
practice of asceticism in order to obtain the fruits of the world
beyond. What is there here for you to dispute?' He said, ‘Do as I say,
if you wish for
release,^{<<chapter5.html_ipg233_fn63>>[[#page_233.html#pg233_fn63][63]]}
for you are worthy of this /dharma/ which is the open door to release.
This is the /dharma/ worthy of release, and there is none better than
this; by following it you will obtain heaven or release. All of you,
mighty ones, are worthy of this /dharm./ ‘With many deductions,
examples, and arguments of this sort, the magic deluder led the demons
from the path of the Vedas: ‘This would be /dharma/, but it would not be
/dharma/; this is, but it is not; this would give release, but it would
not give release; this is the supreme object, but it is also not the
supreme object; this is effect, but it is not effect; this is not
crystal clear. This is the /dharma/ of those who are naked; this is the
/dharma/ of those who wear many clothes.' Thus the magic deluder taught
a varying doctrine of more than one conclusion to the demons, who
abandoned their own /dharma/. And they who took refuge in
<<chapter5.html_page_234>>this dharma became
Ārhatas,^{<<chapter5.html_ipg234_fn64>>[[#page_234.html#pg234_fn64][64]]}
because the magic deluder said to them, ‘You are worthy [/arhata/] of
this great /dharma.'/

When the magic deluder had caused the demons to abandon the /dharma/ of
the triple Vedas, they themselves became his disciples and persuaded
others; and yet others were persuaded by these, and still others by
those, and so in a few days most of the demons abandoned the three
Vedas. Then the magic deluder, who had subdued his senses, put on a red
garment and went and spoke to other demons in soft, short, and honeyed
words: ‘If you demons wish for heaven or for Nirvāņa, then realize that
you must stop these evil rites such as killing animals. Comprehend that
all this universe is perceived only by means of knowledge; understand my
speech properly, for it has been said by wise men. All this universe is
without support and is intent upon achieving what it mistakenly believes
to be knowledge; it wanders in the straits of existence, corrupted by
passion and the other emotions.' As he said to them over and over,
‘Understand! [/budhyata/],' the magic deluder caused the demons to
abandon their own /dharma/, and with various speeches employing logic he
made them gradually abandon the /dharma/ of the triple Vedas. Then they
spoke in this way to others, who addressed yet others in this way, so
that they abandoned the highest /dharma/ which is taught in the Vedas
and lawbooks.

Then the magic deluder, capable of producing total delusion, corrupted
other demons with many other sorts of heresy, and in a very short time
the demons were corrupted by the magic deluder and abandoned the entire
teaching of the triple path of the Vedas. Some reviled the Vedas; others
the gods; and others the collection of sacrificial rituals and the
twice-born. ‘This speech is not logical, that “injury is conducive
<<chapter5.html_page_235>>to
/dharma/”.'^{<<chapter5.html_ipg235_fn65>>[[#page_235.html#pg235_fn65][65]]}
‘It is the babbling of a child, to say that butter burnt as an oblation
in the fire is productive of reward.' ‘If the /śamī/ fire-sticks and
other wood are consumed by Indra, who has become a god by means of many
sacrifices, then a beast who eats leaves is better than Indra.' ‘If an
animal slaughtered in the sacrifice is thus promised entry into heaven,
why does not the sacrificer kill his own father?' ‘If the oblation to
the ancestors which is eaten by one man satisfies another, then people
travelling abroad need not take the trouble to carry
food.'^{<<chapter5.html_ipg235_fn66>>[[#page_235.html#pg235_fn66][66]]}
‘When you have understood what contemptible people will believe in, then
the words I have uttered will please you. The words of authority do not
fall from the sky, great demons; only the speech based upon logic should
be accepted by men and by others like you.'

When the magic deluder had made the demons freethinkers with many
speeches like this, not one of them took pleasure in the triple Vedas.
And when the demons were thus set upon the wrong path, the immortals
made the supreme effort and prepared for battle. Then the battle between
the gods and demons was resumed, and the gods slew the demons, who now
stood in opposition to the right path. The armour of their own /dharma/
which had at first been theirs had formerly protected them, and when it
was destroyed, they were destroyed.

*VIṢŅU BECOMBS INCARNATE AS KALKIN TO END THE KALI AGE*

Kalkin, Viṣņu's final avatar, is the only one yet to come in the
future, the messiah who will appear at the end of the present age, the
Kali <<chapter5.html_page_236>>Age. It is probable that this idea
entered India with the Parthian invasions of the first centuries of the
Christian era, a time when millennial ideas were rampant in Europe.
Kalkin himself has the form of an invader: he comes riding on a white
horse, like the Scythian and Parthian invaders of India. But his purpose
is to destroy the invaders, to raze the wicked cities of the plain which
have been polluted by foreign kings -- these same horsemen -- as well as
to exterminate all heretics, including the Buddhists that he had himself
just produced in his penultimate incarnation.

In reversing the Kali Age in this manner, Viṣņu challenges the force of
time itself, for the Kali Age was /meant/ to be evil. Yet the dice of
fate are not loaded, for the tide of evil civilization seems to turn
even before Viṣņu appears: people leave the wicked cities and eat roots
and wear bark garments, just like virtuous sages; the seeds of the new
Kṛta Age, the golden age, are already sown in the Kali Age, and Viṣņu
merely acts as a catalyst, a cog in the wheel of time.

Unable to support their avaricious kings, the people of the Kali Age
will take refuge in the chasms between mountains, and they will eat
honey, vegetables, roots, fruits, leaves, and flowers. They will wear
ragged garments made of leaves and the bark of trees, and they will have
too many children, and they will be forced to bear cold, wind, sun, and
rain. Noone's age-span will reach twenty-three years, and thus without
respite the entire race will become destroyed in this Kali Age.

When Vedic religion and the /dharma/ of the lawbooks have undergone
total confusion and reversal and the Kali Age is almost exhausted, then
a part of the creator of the entire universe, of the guru of all that
moves and is still, without beginning, middle, or end, who is made of

DEVĪ, THE GODDESS
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: chapter6.html_calibre_pb_0
:CLASS: calibre1
:END:
THE Goddess has been worshipped in India from prehistoric times, for
strong evidence of a cult of the Mother has been unearthed at the
pre-Vedic civilization of the Indus Valley (/c/. 2000 B.C.). Her
assimilation into the Hindu pantheon, however, took place long after
Śiva and Viṣņu had been accepted, and in two distinct phases: first the
Indo-Aryan male gods were given wives, and then, under the influence of
Tantric and Śāktic movements which had been gaining momentum outside
orthodox Hinduism for many centuries, these shadowy female figures
emerged as supreme powers in their own right, and merged into the great
Goddess. Abstract nouns, grammatically feminine, had occasionally been
personified and ‘wedded' to the great gods; thus Śrī (Prosperity)
‘belonged' to Viṣņu, and Śiva had his Śakti or Power, but these
personifications merely expressed the qualities of the god to whom they
were attached. Similarly, female divinities had served as the objects or
instruments of divine struggles from the earliest times; thus Saramā was
used to win the cattle from the Paņis, and Pārvatī was used first to
cause Śiva to beget a son and then to tempt Andhaka to his doom. But
when the Goddess came into her element in the medieval period, these
early myths were retold in a new light, with the Goddess using the gods
to serve her higher purposes.

*Devī slays the buffalo demon*

The myth of the slaughter of the buffalo demon (Mahiṣa) falls clearly
into the corpus of sacrificial myths which includes the beheading of
Dakṣa (the goat) and the dissolution of the cosmic boar. As this is the
<<chapter6.html_page_239>>most famous myth of the Goddess, it is usually
the occasion for a description of her birth, which takes place in a
manner similar to the creation of Rudra and of Śiva's
chariot;^{<<chapter6.html_ipg239_fn1>>[[#page_239.html#pg239_fn1][1]]}
parts of all the gods combine to form a deity more powerful than all of
them, the whole that is greater than the sum of its parts.

*DEVĪ AND THE BUFFALO DEMON ARE BORN*

**** 64. FROM THE /Skanda Purāņa/
:PROPERTIES:
:CLASS: calibre16
:END:
In times past, in the battle between gods and demons, the sons of Diti
were destroyed by the gods. Then Diti was distraught by grief, and she
said to her daughter, ‘Go, my daughter, and practise asceticism in a
grove of asceticism for the sake of a son, so that because of that son
Indra and the other gods, who have restrained their senses and are
self-controlled, will no longer remain, O fair-hipped one.' When the
daughter heard her mother's words, she bowed to her and took the form of
a buffalo; she went to the forest and sat between five
fires.^{<<chapter6.html_ipg239_fn2>>[[#page_239.html#pg239_fn2][2]]} She
practised asceticism so dreadful that the worlds trembled and the triple
world was agitated by fear of her asceticism, and Indra and the other
bands of gods and the supreme twice-born ones were stupefied. The sage
Supārśva was shaken by her asceticism and said to her, ‘Fair-hipped one,
I am satisfied. You will have a son with the head of a buffalo and the
body of a man, and your son's name will be Mahiṣa [‘Buffalo']. He will
have heroic energy in excess, and he will oppress heaven and Indra and
his army.' When Supārśva had thus spoken to her to cause her to desist
from her asceticism, he went back to his own world, taking the ascetic
woman with him. Then the buffalo was born as Brahmā had formerly
predicted, and he grew up and increased in heroic power as the great
ocean grows during a lunar fortnight.

<<chapter6.html_page_240>>Then Vidyunmālin, the general of the demons,
the son of Vipracitti, and other demon chiefs who live on the surface of
the earth all heard of the boon that had been given to the buffalo, and
they assembled joyously and said to the buffalo demon, ‘Formerly we were
kings in heaven, O clever one, but our kingdom was forcibly stolen by
the gods when they sought refuge with
Viṣņu.^{<<chapter6.html_ipg240_fn3>>[[#page_240.html#pg240_fn3][3]]}
Bring that kingdom back to us by force; display your heroic power and
your majesty today, buffalo demon. Your strength and heroism are
unparalleled, and you have been elevated by the boon given by Brahmā.
Conquer the husband of Śacī and the hosts of the gods in battle.' When
the buffalo of great heroic power heard what the demons said, he began
to wish to fight with the immortals, and he set out for Amarāvatī, the
city of the gods.

A fierce, hair-raising battle between the gods and demons then took
place for a hundred years, and at first the multitude of gods was put to
flight in all directions; placing the Shatterer of Cities before them,
they went to Brahmā in terror. Then Brahmā took all the immortals back
to Nārāyaņa and Śiva, the protectors of everything, and he arrived and
bowed and praised them with many hymns of praise, and he reported to the
two gods, Śambhu and Kṛṣņa, what the buffalo demon had done and how
the demons had oppressed the gods: ‘He has thrown Indra, Agni, Yama, the
sun, the moon, Kubera, Varuņa and the others out of their positions of
authority and assumed these positions himself; and he has usurped the
positions of others among the multitude of gods as well. The gods have
been thrown out of the world of heaven down to the surface of the earth
and are wandering like men, hard pressed by the buffalo demon. I have
come here with the bands of gods to report this to you two gods; protect
those who have come here.'

<<chapter6.html_page_241>>When Viṣņu, the husband of Laksmī, and the
great lord Śiva heard the speech of Brahmā, their angry faces became so
monstrous that one could not look upon them. From Viṣņu's mouth, that
blazed with extreme anger, his great energy came forth, and similarly
from Śambhu and from the Creator, and from the bodies of Indra and all
the other gods the cruel energies came forth and they all became one.
The great mass of their united energies seemed to all the multitudes of
gods like a blazing mountain that pervaded all the regions of the sky
with flames. Then from the combination of these energies a certain woman
appeared: her head appeared from the energy of Śiva, her two arms from
the energy of Viṣņu, her two feet from the energy of Brahmā, and her
waist from the energy of Indra; her hair was made from Yama's energy,
her two breasts from the moon's energy, her thighs from the energy of
Varuņa, her hips from the earth's energy, her toes from the sun's
energy; her fingers were formed by the energy of the Vasus, her nose by
Kubera's energy, her rows of teeth from the energy of the nine
Prajāpatis; her two eyes arose from the energy of the Oblation-bearer;
the two twilights became her two brows, and her ears were made from the
energy of the wind; and from the incredibly fierce energies of the other
gods other limbs were made for the woman who was the supremely radiant
Durgā, more dangerous than all the gods and demons.

*DEVĪ ENTICES THE BUFFALO DEMON*

In another version of this myth the Goddess is not created expressly in
order to kill the buffalo demon but is considered to exist already; now
the gods give her not their energies but their weapons. The gods beg her
to assume the role of a celestial nymph, to seduce and thus weaken the
demon; but, unlike the conventional nymph, she is to kill him herself.
This motif of the /Liebestod/ appears in other myths of the Goddess; the
demons Śumbha and Niśumbha, who were originally seduced by the most
famous of celestial nymphs, Tilottamā, meet their death when they are
overcome by desire for <<chapter6.html_page_242>>the Goddess, as does
the demon
Andhaka;^{<<chapter6.html_ipg242_fn4>>[[#page_242.html#pg242_fn4][4]]}
and later, under Tantric influence, Śiva himself, her husband, is slain
by Devī.

A number of motifs are taken from the myth of Śiva and Pārvatī with the
roles reversed and distributed between Devī and the buffalo: Devī places
four guards at her door, just as she stations Vīraka when she goes to
win a golden skin, and as Śiva stations guards to prevent the intrusions
of Kāma, Bhṛgu, and
Agni;^{<<chapter6.html_ipg242_fn5>>[[#page_242.html#pg242_fn5][5]]} and
the servants of the buffalo elude those guards in the same form that
Agni assumes for this purpose, that of a bird. The buffalo then
approaches the ascetic girl in disguise, just as Śiva approaches Gaurī;
and he tries to lure her from Śiva as Jalandhara and Andhaka attempt to
do. In this particular variant, it is Śiva, rather than Brahmā, who
grants a boon to the demon: he will meet his death at the hands of the
Goddess, a death which is considered to be a boon, releasing him from
his sins (and from the buffalo form in which his soul is imprisoned)
just as Śiva releases Andhaka and the boar and Kṛṣņa releases
Pūtanā.^{<<chapter6.html_ipg242_fn6>>[[#page_242.html#pg242_fn6][6]]}

**** 65. FROM THE /Skanda Purāņa/
:PROPERTIES:
:CLASS: calibre16
:END:
The gods were so oppressed by the buffalo demon that they left the earth
and went in distress to seek refuge with Gaurī, who was practising
asceticism. They bowed to her and said, ‘Grant us safety, O Goddess,'
and when the Goddess saw how alarmed and frightened the immortals were
she asked, ‘What is to be done?' Then Indra and the other gods cupped
their palms and reported to the Goddess the danger that had been caused
them by the demon king: ‘He plays happily in the Nandana garden,
surrounded by celestial nymphs,' said the gods. ‘For his amusement, he
has brought Airāvata and all the other elephants of the regions of the
sky,^{<<chapter6.html_ipg242_fn7>>[[#page_242.html#pg242_fn7][7]]}
together with their <<chapter6.html_page_243>>elephant cows, to live in
his own palace. He uses a hundred thousand times ten million horses,
headed by Uccaiḥśravas, in his elegant stables; he has let his sons
ride on the ram that is the vehicle of the Oblation-eater, and he has
hitched the buffalo of Yama to a cart. He has dragged off all the
goddesses of perfection and instructed them to do housework, and he has
brought the entire group of celestial nymphs for his own service.
Whatever other precious thing or gem there is in the triple universe
that he has not already carried off he will not hesitate to carry off in
fury. We have become his servants and are in constant terror; we honour
all his commands, for we see no other way open to us.

‘The protection of those who have come for refuge is said to be the
fruit of asceticism; this supreme demon is hard for even all the mighty
gods and demons to conquer, for he has been elevated by the boon
obtained from Śiva. He has struck the ocean with his horn and made it
totally destitute, for he demands that
gems^{<<chapter6.html_ipg243_fn8>>[[#page_243.html#pg243_fn8][8]]} be
given to him constantly as peace offerings, and the ocean wishes to
please him. The haughty one has uprooted the mountains with the tip of
his horn, and he playfully dusts himself with the powder which he has
made by pounding to dust all the minerals. His matchless strength cannot
be challenged by anyone other than you; but you yourself know this by
means of your own energy. The /śakti/ of Śambhu appeared long ago in the
form of a
woman,^{<<chapter6.html_ipg243_fn9>>[[#page_243.html#pg243_fn9][9]]} and
the demon has obtained from Śiva the boon that he can only be slain by
that woman, you. We know nothing about Śambhu's foolish misdeeds,
Goddess; but we are to be protected by you alone, always, mother of the
universe.'

When the Goddess heard this fine speech from those who were tortured by
fear, her soul was undisturbed and she spoke
<<chapter6.html_page_244>>to them, giving them reassurance: ‘While I am
engaged in asceticism I will protect those who come to me for refuge,
immortals. In a while, your enemy will be worn out; I will draw him in
by some wily means and kill the great demon. But it is not proper for me
to kill one who has not yet committed any offence, for those who violate
/dharma/ go the way of moths, O followers of /dharma/.' When the gods
heard this speech they bowed to the daughter of the mountain and they
all returned whence they had come, free from fear, rejoicing in their
hearts. When the gods had gone, the lotus-eyed Gaurī became an
enchantress, full of loveliness, with a rounded belly. The Goddess
stationed four fine young boys on the four peaks of the Tawny
Mountain^{<<chapter6.html_ipg244_fn10>>[[#page_244.html#pg244_fn10][10]]}
to protect it on the north, south, east, and west. The daughter of the
mountain went away from the peak of Kailāsa, followed by the four
mothers, her four servants, Kettle-drum, Truthful, Exalted, and
Beautiful,^{<<chapter6.html_ipg244_fn11>>[[#page_244.html#pg244_fn11][11]]}
who followed her to serve her. She said to the four boys, ‘No one is to
see this Tawny Mountain except a traveller who is exhausted and
suffering from hunger and thirst.'

When she had thus instructed the fine heroic boys and stationed them at
the boundary peaks, the daughter of the mountain practised asceticism
near the hermitage of Gautama. While the slender woman was practising
asceticism, there were no calamities at all: the clouds sent rain at the
proper time, the trees bore fruit, and all opposed creatures gave up
their former ill-will. The hermitage became a refuge for all creatures,
protecting them from all dangers, and the Tawny Mountain was guarded for
a distance of two leagues on all sides by the four heroic young boys who
were stationed at the boundary peaks. There was no alarm, no fear; no
one was <<chapter6.html_page_245>>tortured by disease, nor was there any
erection excited by a woman. All the sages achieved their goals and
praised the daughter of the mountain; and some praised that hermitage as
being the site of the world of Śiva. Gaurī practised her fearful
asceticism day and night, but the girl was not content, for she wished
to satisfy Śiva.

The heroic buffalo set out to go hunting and wandered through the whole
forest far from the Blood-red Mountain, attended by his demon army. He
killed many herds of wild animals in the forests and ate them as he
wandered about swiftly. Some of the wild animals who fled in terror,
pursued by the mighty archers, entered that hermitage. The demons
pursued the wild beasts, determined to kill them, but they were
prevented by the heroic young boys who said quickly, ‘Do not come here.'
The evil demons asked the boys, ‘What is this?' and the boys answered
promptly, ‘The maiden who has excellent hips is practising asceticism
here. No mighty
one^{<<chapter6.html_ipg245_fn12>>[[#page_245.html#pg245_fn12][12]]} can
enter this place that is used by sages, the Goddess's place of
asceticism, which offers protection to those who come for refuge.' When
the mighty and evil demons heard this speech, they agreed and turned
back quickly, debating what to do. By means of their magic power of
illusion they took the form of birds and carefully entered the hermitage
and settled on the branches of the trees in the grove in order to look
for food.

Then the generals of the demon magician saw the Goddess practising
asceticism in that graceful forest full of the flowers of all seasons,
and when they saw the loveliness of her form as she remained firm in her
asceticism, they were so astonished that they went and reported to him
what they had seen. He was tortured with desire, and he took the form of
an old man and entered the hermitage and was received respectfully by
her girl-friends. As the old man stood there, his exhaustion seemed to
be removed, and he asked them, ‘What is the reason
<<chapter6.html_page_246>>for her asceticism?' ‘The girl has been
practising asceticism here for a long time in order to propitiate her
beloved,' they replied, ‘but her mighty beloved, the lord without
precedent, has not yet been sufficiently propitiated to fulfil her wish
with the customary ritual of the great nine-fold ceremony of marriage.
To please him, she will offer a new-born wild cock, with newly picked
ripe fruits, pots of freshly cooked rice, all means such as these,
quantities of valuable things and riches such as have never been seen
before, and when her offerings have met with success she will
immediately choose her husband.'

When the buffalo heard their speech he laughed and replied, ‘I have
arrived and stand here, the true fruit of her asceticism. Ascetic
girl,^{<<chapter6.html_ipg246_fn13>>[[#page_246.html#pg246_fn13][13]]}
hear of my full grandeur. I am the heroic buffalo, king of the demons,
respected by the gods; I hold this entire triple universe by the prowess
of my own arms, and there is really no other hero. Young girl, I am able
to assume any form I desire, and I can supply all sensual enjoyments.
Choose me as your husband, the fruit of the asceticism of creatures that
have breath. I will accomplish everything by means of the magic
wishing-trees that I have stolen, and by my ascetic power I will create
the primeval Viśvakarman and I will create a thousand wishing-cows in a
moment. Through the resources of my nine treasure-houses and my constant
attendants, I will obtain immediately the absolute possession of any
object I wish for.'

When she heard his speech, she remembered the gods, and she slowly
abandoned her silence and smiled gently and said to him, ‘I have
practised asceticism for a long time in order to be the wife of a mighty
man. If you are mighty, then show me your own might. Demonstrate your
own true womanish nature.' When he heard that speech, the buffalo demon
bellowed furiously, ‘What! Who is this?', and when the maiden
<<chapter6.html_page_247>>Durgā saw the buffalo demon coming at her to
kill her, she took the unassailable form of a fire. But when the demon
in the form of a buffalo saw her standing before him, blazing with her
great magic power of illusion, he himself grew great as Mount Meru. He
tossed up all the mountain peaks with his two horns again and again and
summoned his own army, who filled all the corners of the sky.

Then Brahmā and the gods came there and bowed to Durgā, who had the form
of the doomsday fire, and worshipped her by giving her all their own
various weapons. Hari gave her five weapons, and the eternal Śiva gave
her ten. Brahmā gave her four that were invisible because of their magic
power of illusion; the Protectors of the Regions of the Sky and the
other gods and the mountains and the clouds all gave her offerings of
their own ornaments and weapons. The magic Goddess, Durgā, filled her
many hands with blazing weapons, and she put on her armour and quickly
mounted her
lion.^{<<chapter6.html_ipg247_fn14>>[[#page_247.html#pg247_fn14][14]]}
The terrible energy of Durgā filled the very circumference of the skies,
and when the buffalo saw it he fled, for he was unable to bear it. When
she saw that the buffalo was fleeing, unable to bear her own violent
energy, she reflected, ‘This wicked buffalo demon must be killed by some
wily means; wild animals, when they are in rut, are caught by hunters in
the forest. I will send my envoys to attract him with persuasive
speeches, to tell him of my vital weak spots and to stir his anger, and
thus I will make him attack me in a moment...'

*DEVī SLAYS THE BUFFALO DEMON*

The original core of the buffalo myth is the climax, the bloody
slaughter, to which the episodes of birth and enticement were later
added to build up the tension. In the oldest version of this battle, as
it <<chapter6.html_page_248>>appears in the /Mārkaņḍeya Purāņa/, there
is little trace of the seductive aspect of Devī, though in her orgiastic
drinking of wine and blood one may perhaps detect another, darker side
of her erotic nature.

When his own army was totally destroyed, the buffalo demon assumed his
own buffalo form and terrified the troops of the Goddess. Some he struck
with his muzzle; others he trampled with his hooves. Some he lashed with
his tail and pierced with his two horns; others he rushed at and roared
at and whirled around; and still others he hurled down upon the surface
of the earth by means of the hurricane of his breath. When he had thus
felled the vanguard of the Goddess's army, the great demon attacked her
lion in order to kill him, and then the Mother became angry. The great
hero was angry too, and he pounded the surface of the earth with his
hooves and tossed the mountains high with his two horns, and he roared.
The earth was shattered by the poundings of his swift turns; the ocean,
lashed by his tail, overflowed on all sides; the clouds, pierced by his
swaying horns, were broken into fragments; and mountains fell from the
sky by the hundreds, cast down by the blast of his breath.

When the fierce Goddess saw the great demon attacking, swollen thus with
anger, she became frantic to slay him. She hurled her noose over him and
bound the great demon; but when he was thus bound in the great struggle
he abandoned his buffalo form and became a lion. When the Mother cut off
his head, he appeared as a man with a sword in his hand and a shield
made of hide, but the Goddess took her arrows and quickly pierced the
man. Then he became a great elephant, who pulled at the great lion with
his trunk and trumpeted, but the Goddess took her sword and cut off his
trunk as he pulled. Then the great demon once more assumed his buffalo
shape and shook the triple world, moving and still. Enraged
<<chapter6.html_page_249>>by this, the furious mother of the universe
drank the supreme
wine^{<<chapter6.html_ipg249_fn15>>[[#page_249.html#pg249_fn15][15]]}
again and again; her eyes became red, and she laughed. The demon roared,
puffed up and intoxicated with his own strength and courage, and with
his two horns he hurled mountains at the furious Goddess, but she
pulverized his missiles with a hail of arrows.

Then she spoke to him, her syllables confused with passion as they
tumbled from her mouth which was loosened by intoxication. The Goddess
said, ‘Roar and roar for a moment, you fool, while I drink this honeyed
wine. The gods will soon roar when I have slain you here.' Then she
leaped up and mounted that great demon and kicked him in the neck with
her foot and pierced him with her trident. When he was struck by her
foot he^{<<chapter6.html_ipg249_fn16>>[[#page_249.html#pg249_fn16][16]]}
came half way out of his own mouth, for he was enveloped in the
Goddess's heroic power. And as the great demon came half way out,
fighting, the Goddess cut off his head with his great sword, and he
fell. Thus the demon named Buffalo was destroyed by the Goddess,
together with his army and her band of friends, when he had bewitched
the triple world. And when the buffalo had fallen, all creatures in the
triple world, along with all the gods and demons and men, shouted,
‘Victory!' A cry of lamentation arose from the entire demon army as it
was destroyed, and all the bands of gods rejoiced. Then the gods and the
heavenly great sages praised the Goddess, the Gandharva leaders sang,
and the bands of celestial nymphs danced.

*The corpse of Satī is dismembered*

The Goddess herself is the subject of a /Liebestod/ in a myth strongly
reminiscent of the tale of Isis and Osiris. In this late variation on
the <<chapter6.html_page_250>>Dakṣa myth, Satī's body is reduced back
to the component parts from which it was originally fashioned, just as
the universe itself is dismembered at doomsday; both of these
dismemberments lead to new forms of creation and salvation. Here, Śiva
dances erotically with her corpse just as (in still later Tantric myths)
she unites sexually with the corpse of Śiva. This myth is also derived
in part from the cycle of myths of the castration of Śiva, for when she
is mutilated (as he is), it is sometimes stated that Śiva takes the form
of a /liṅga/ to remain with each part of her body, particularly with
the female organ (/yoni/) that falls into Assam.

One day the sage Durvāsas saw the Goddess, the empress of gold, and he
murmured the prayer of magic illusion. Then the empress of the gods was
pleased with him, and took from her own neck a garland rich in sweet
nectar around which humming bees hovered. She gave this to him as a
favour, and the ascetic sage received it upon his head and flew away
quickly through the sky. He came to the place where Dakṣa, the father
of Satī, lived, and he bowed at the feet of Satī in order to have a
sight of the Mother. Then Dakṣa asked the sage, ‘Whose is this garland
that is not of this world? How did you, my lord, obtain what is hard for
men in the world to obtain?' Durvāsas replied with tears in his eyes,
stammering because of the love in his heart, ‘This was a matchless
favour from the Goddess.' The father of Satī asked the sage for that
garland, and the sage thought, ‘Nothing in the orb of the triple world
should be denied to one who is devoted to the Śakti.' And so he gave the
garland to that man, Dakṣa, who received the garland upon his head and
placed it upon the exquisite marital bed in his own palace. At night,
the man was so delighted by the perfume of the garland that he made love
in the manner of a mere beast; and because of this evil, the king
conceived in his mind a hatred for Śiva, Śaṅkara, and even for the
Goddess Satī. Because of this offence, Satī burnt that body, which
<<chapter6.html_page_251>>the man had begotten, in the fire of her yoga,
with a desire to demonstrate the /dharma/ of
‘suttee'^{<<chapter6.html_ipg251_fn17>>[[#page_251.html#pg251_fn17][17]]}...

Then the triple world was totally destroyed by the fire of Śiva's anger,
and Śiva engendered Vīrabhadra and the army of Bhadrakālī. When
Vīrabhadra set out to destroy the triple world, Brahmā and the other
gods sought refuge with Śaṅkara. And even when everything had been
destroyed, the noble lord who is an ocean of pity granted them safety,
and gave the head of a goat to the man Dakṣa and revived him. Then the
great lord was exhausted, went to the sacrificial ground and wept in
great sorrow. When he saw Satī being burnt in the fire, he placed her on
his shoulder and cried out over and over again, ‘Alas, Satī!' Then
Śaṅkara wandered in confusion through various places, and Brahmā and
the other gods became extremely worried, and Viṣņu quickly took up his
bow and arrows and cut away the limbs of Satī, which fell in several
places. In each place, Hara assumed a different form, and he said to the
gods, ‘Whoever worships Śiva with great devotion in these places will
find nothing unattainable, for the great Mother is constantly present in
her own limbs there. And whoever among mortals performs the rituals in
these places will have their prayers answered, especially the prayer of
magic illusion.' When Śaṅkara had said this, he remained in those
places forever, meditating and praying, tortured by separation.

*Kālī obtains a golden skin and Śiva slays the demon Āḍi in her form*

The antagonistic aspect of love which is implicit in the /Liebestod/
appears on two levels in the myth of Kālī and Āḍi. First Śiva and
Pārvatī quarrel in an apparently human way, squabbling and pouting
<<chapter6.html_page_252>>(with their sons supplying the usual focus for
their conflict and separation); but their quarrels play upon their
divine attributes, revealing the opposition which heightens and
strengthens their ultimate union, their re-fusion into the primeval
androgyne. Then Āḍi seeks and finds a literal death-in-love, even as he
seeks to kill Śiva by a literally sexual means. These ambivalences of
love and death are evident within the Goddess herself, who here divides
herself into her two contrasting aspects -- the golden, erotic Gaurī and
the black goddess of death, Kālī. Āḍi's name designates an aquatic
bird, which may have been his original form and is a form assumed by
other gods who wish to elude
door-keepers;^{<<chapter6.html_ipg252_fn18>>[[#page_252.html#pg252_fn18][18]]}
his transformation into a serpent is therefore yet another instance of
symbolic
opposition.^{<<chapter6.html_ipg252_fn19>>[[#page_252.html#pg252_fn19][19]]}

One day, the great lord Śiva tossed his arm around the neck of the
daughter of the mountain, the Goddess, and spoke in jest to her in order
to bring about a particular act of asceticism. Now, Śarva had a pale
body, made particularly pale because of the crescent
moon^{<<chapter6.html_ipg252_fn20>>[[#page_252.html#pg252_fn20][20]]}
upon him, while the Goddess gleamed with skin like the petal of a blue
lotus at night. Śarva said, ‘Your slender body, shining darkly upon my
white body, looks like a black female serpent coiled around a white
sandalwood tree. You look like a dark night touched by the light of the
moon, like the night during the dark half of the lunar month; indeed,
you offend my sight.' When the daughter of the mountain heard this from
him, she released her neck from Śarva's embrace, her eyes grew red with
anger, her face was distorted in a frown, and she said, ‘Everyone blames
someone else for his own deeds, and when anyone seeks something he is
inevitably disappointed. I sought to win you, who wear a fragment of the
moon, with shining acts of asceticism, and the reward for all my careful
vow is that I am dishonoured <<chapter6.html_page_253>>thus at every
step. I am not
crooked,^{<<chapter6.html_ipg253_fn21>>[[#page_253.html#pg253_fn21][21]]}
Śarva with the matted locks, nor am I irregular. You are patient enough
with your own faults -- and you are richly endowed with a veritable mine
of faults. It is not I who knocked out eyes, Bhava; you are the
eye-destroyer, and Bhaga and indeed the whole triple universe knows you
well. You would place a trident on my head, casting your own faults upon
me. You called me ‘Black', but you are famous as the great black
one.^{<<chapter6.html_ipg253_fn22>>[[#page_253.html#pg253_fn22][22]]} I
will go to the mountain to abandon my body by means of asceticism; there
is no use in my living just to be insulted by a rogue.'

When Bhava heard her speech, in which every syllable was sharpened by
anger, he was upset, and Hara, whose actions are hard to comprehend,
said, ‘Daughter of the mountain, you do not know the true state of
affairs. I did not mean to blame you; it was with the intention of
flattering that I spoke in jest. I was thinking, “My darling, the
daughter of the mountain, has a mind pellucid as rock-crystal,” but
people like us, whose dark bodies are smeared with white ashes, have one
sort of thought in the heart, but our words express the opposite
thought. But if you are angry at this, I will not speak to you in jest
again, terrifying lady, brightly smiling one. Control your anger. I bow
to you with my head, and I fold my palms in reverence to you...'

With many such words of flattery and hymns of praise the god sought to
change her mind, but the virtuous woman did not let go of her anger, for
she had been touched on a sore spot. Snatching away her two feet which
had been propped up by the hand of Śaṅkara, the daughter of the
mountain prepared to leave quickly, her hair in disarray. As she set
out, the destroyer of the cities said to her angrily, ‘Truly, the
daughter <<chapter6.html_page_254>>is like her father in all her ways.
Your heart is as hard to fathom as a cavern of Himālaya, in which many
sharp blades have accumulated, fallen from his cloud-garlanded peaks;
your cruelty comes from his rock; your inconsistency from his various
trees; your crookedness from his winding rivers; and you are as
difficult to enjoy carnally as snow. All of this has been transferred to
you, Goddess, from the snowy mountain, Himālaya.'

When the daughter of the mountain was addressed in this way, her dark
red mouth shook with anger, her lips trembled, and she said to the lord
of the mountain, ‘Śarva, do not blame virtuous people by comparing them
with yourself, for all these faults have been transferred to you in the
same way by your association with the wicked. You speak with many
tongues because of your serpents; and you are devoid of
affection^{<<chapter6.html_ipg254_fn23>>[[#page_254.html#pg254_fn23][23]]}
because of your ashes. Your heart is defiled by the moon which is
stained with a hare, and you get your stupidity from your bull. But what
is the use of all this talk, which is merely tiresome to me? You are
frightening because you live in the burning-ground, and you have no
modesty, because you are naked. You are disgusting, because you carry a
skull; who could bear you thus?'

When the daughter of Himālaya had said this, she went out of the palace,
and as she left the hosts of Śiva raised an uproar and ran after her,
crying, ‘Mother, where are you going?'
Vīraka^{<<chapter6.html_ipg254_fn24>>[[#page_254.html#pg254_fn24][24]]}
grasped the feet of the Goddess and stammered tearfully, ‘Mother, what
is this? Where are you hastening so angrily? I will come with you and
follow my mother who is full of affection to her child. If you abandon
me, I shall not be able to bear the cruelty of the lord of the mountain;
for a son is a vessel to receive his father's cruelty in the absence of
his <<chapter6.html_page_255>>mother.' Vīraka's mother lifted up his
face with her right hand and said to him, ‘Do not grieve, my son. It is
not proper for you to go with me, for you might fall off the tip of a
mountain, but I will tell you what is right for you to do. Hara reviled
me and treated me as if I were a blade of grass. Since he called me
“Black”, I will practise asceticism in order to become golden [/gaurī/].
But this Hara who has a pale golden body is a woman-chaser when I am
absent, and so you must constantly guard his door, and peep through the
keyhole, so that no woman enters his presence. If you see another woman
here, report to me quickly, my little son, and I will immediately do
what is proper.' ‘So be it,' said Vīraka to the Goddess, and when he had
received his mother's command his whole body was flooded with joy and he
was no longer worried. He prostrated himself before his mother and went
to watch the three-eyed one.

Then the elephant-headed Gaņeśa bowed to her and begged her, with tears
in his throat, ‘Take me too, Pārvatī,' and she answered, ‘He will laugh
at you because you are elephant-headed, my son, just as he laughs at me.
Therefore come with me; go where I go, for death is good when it results
from the humiliation of rogues, my little son.' And so she took him with
her and set out for Himālaya.

As the daughter of the mountain set out, she saw a friend of her mother,
a glorious divinity of the mountain, named Kusumāmodinī. When this lady
saw the daughter of the mountain, her heart was filled with affectionate
concern, and she embraced her and asked where she was going. The
daughter of the mountain told her mother's intimate friend everything
that had caused her to become angry with Śaṅkara, and then she
continued, ‘Blameless lady, you are the eternal divinity of the supreme
king of mountains, and you have always treated me most affectionately,
like your own child. Therefore I will tell you what I would have you do
now: <<chapter6.html_page_256>>if another woman enters the presence of
the god who wields the Pināka bow, tell me and I will then do what is
proper, fair lady.' The goddess of the mountain assented, and the
Goddess Pārvatī went to the mountain and laid aside her ornaments and
put on garments made of the bark of trees. There, on a delightful high
peak shining with various wonders, the daughter of the mountain
practised asceticism, while her son guarded her. In summer she heated
herself with the five fires, and in the monsoon she lived in the water;
in the winter she slept on the bare ground and went without food.

At this time, Āḍi, the mighty son of the demon Andhaka, brother of
Baka, found out that the daughter of the mountain had gone away, and he
sought a secret entrance, for he remembered the enmity between his
father and Śiva. For when the demon Andhaka, hater of the gods, had been
conquered by Śiva the lord of the mountain, Āḍi had practised extensive
asceticism because he wished to conquer Hara. Brahmā had been satisfied
by his asceticism and had come to him and said, ‘Tell me what it is that
you wish to accomplish by this asceticism, O best of demons.' The demon
had said to Brahmā, ‘I choose immortality,' but Brahmā replied, ‘No
living creature can exist without death. An embodied creature obtains
death from one source or another, O demon, lord of demons.' On hearing
this, the lion among demons replied to the lotus-born god, ‘When I have
changed my form, then let my death come about, but otherwise let me be
immortal, O lotus-born god.' The lotus-born god agreed to this, for he
was satisfied. And when the demon had received this promise, he
considered himself immortal, and he established the kingdom of the
demons.

Then he went to the dwelling-place of the slayer of the triple city, and
when he arrived he saw Vīraka stationed at the door. In order to deceive
him, Āḍi took the form of a serpent and entered Hara's presence
unhindered by Vīraka. The <<chapter6.html_page_257>>great demon then
abandoned the form of a serpent and took the form of Umā, thinking
stupidly that he could thus trick the lord of the mountain. The demon
took the form of Umā, more charming than can be imagined, perfect in all
her limbs, complete with all the signs of identity, and he placed hard
teeth like thunderbolts with sharp tips inside the vagina, for his wits
were so deluded that he intended to kill the lord of the mountain. The
demon stood in Hara's presence in the form of Umā, and when the lord of
the mountain saw ‘her' he was satisfied, and he embraced the great
demon, thinking him to be the daughter of the mountain because of the
perfect detail of ‘her' limbs.

Then he asked, ‘Is it truly you, and not some imitation daughter of the
mountain? Did you come here because you knew my hopes, O lady with a
superb complexion? I find this triple universe empty when I am separated
from you, and so it is good that you have relented and come to me in
this way.' The demon in the form of Umā concealed his true feelings and
said, ‘I went to practise matchless asceticism because you called me
“Black”, but there was no sexual pleasure for me there, and so I have
come to you.' When Śaṅkara heard this, he began to feel somewhat
doubtful, thinking, ‘The slender woman was angry with me, and she is
obviously one who keeps her vow. How can she have come back without
having obtained her desire? This is my secret doubt.' As he pondered in
this way, he searched for signs of identity, and he did not see the mark
of a lotus made with a twist of hair on her left side. Then the god who
wields the Pināka bow realized that this was the demon's magic power of
illusion, and he laughed a little and placed a dangerous weapon upon his
phallus and satisfied the demon's desire. The demon screamed terrible
screams and died.

Vīraka did not know about the slaughter of the king of demons, but the
mountain goddess, who had not uncovered <<chapter6.html_page_258>>the
true event, reported to the daughter of the mountain by means of a swift
breeze, when the demon was killed. When the goddess heard this from the
mouth of the wind, her eyes grew very red with anger, and in her
tortured mind she pictured her son Vīraka, and said, ‘Since you
abandoned me, your mother who is besotted with affection for you, and
gave an opportunity for women to enjoy the privacy of Śaṅkara,
therefore your mother will be a stone marked with the syllable of
Gaņeśa,^{<<chapter6.html_ipg258_fn25>>[[#page_258.html#pg258_fn25][25]]}
rough, harsh, cold, heartless.' When the daughter of the mountain had
uttered this curse, her anger immediately came forth out of her mouth in
the form of a mighty lion. That lion which had been emitted from the
Goddess when she had amassed ascetic power had a monstrous mouth like a
cave filled with teeth, a great mane, and an enormous tail. His hungry
tongue hung out of his gaping mouth, and his waist was slender.

The Goddess determined to enter his mouth as a good
wife,^{<<chapter6.html_ipg258_fn26>>[[#page_258.html#pg258_fn26][26]]}
but Brahmā, the four-headed lord, knew what was in her mind and came to
her hermitage which was the home of all good things; he spoke to the
daughter of the mountain with soothing words, saying, ‘What do you wish
to achieve, O Goddess? What is unobtainable? I will give it to you.'
When the daughter of the mountain heard that, she spoke words pregnant
with respect for Brahmā, her guru, saying, ‘I won Śaṅkara for my
husband by practising difficult asceticism, but since Bhava now often
calls me “Dark-skinned”, I would have a golden form and be his beloved
and enter into unity with the body of my husband, the lord of ghosts.'
Then the <<chapter6.html_page_259>>god who sits on a lotus replied, ‘So
be it. You will share
half^{<<chapter6.html_ipg259_fn27>>[[#page_259.html#pg259_fn27][27]]} of
your husband's body.'

Then a woman whose skin was the colour of a dark blue lotus came out of
her body, terrifying, three-eyed, holding a bell in her
hand.^{<<chapter6.html_ipg259_fn28>>[[#page_259.html#pg259_fn28][28]]}
Her body was densely adorned with various ornaments, and she wore yellow
and red garments. Brahmā then said to the goddess whose skin was the
colour of a blue lotus, ‘By contact with the body of the daughter of the
mountain when your form was a part of her, and by my command, you have
been perfected. You alone are her entire original form, not merely a
part of her.

‘This mighty lion which was born from the anger of the Goddess will be
your vehicle and he will be on your banner, O Goddess. Go to the Vindhya
mountains and there do the work of the gods, killing Śumbha and
Niśumbha, Tāraka's generals. This Yakṣa, known as Pāñcāla, is given to
you as your servant, endowed with hundreds of feats of magic illusion
and attended by one hundred thousand Yakṣas, O Goddess.' The goddess
Kauśikī^{<<chapter6.html_ipg259_fn29>>[[#page_259.html#pg259_fn29][29]]}
assented, and when Kauśikī had gone away, Umā became endowed with all
those qualities which she had earned in her previous existence and which
she herself had obtained in her present incarnation.

But although she had obtained her desire, Umā was full of remorse and
blamed herself over and over again as she went back to the lord of the
mountain. When Vīraka saw her returning, he held up his golden rod and
stopped her stead-fastly at the door, shouting angrily at the Goddess,
‘Stay there! Stand! Where are you going? You have no business
<<chapter6.html_page_260>>here. Go away so that you will not be
threatened. A demon in the form of the Goddess entered here unseen in
order to deceive the god, who slew him. And when he had been slain, the
wise blue-necked god reprimanded me, saying, “Be careful not to let any
woman get past you, my son.” Therefore you will not be able to enter
here even if you remain here at the door for many years, so go away. The
only one who can enter here is my mother, the daughter of the king of
mountains, Pārvatī, the darling of Rudra, who loves her child dearly.'

When the Goddess heard this, she thought to herself, ‘It wasn't a woman;
it was a demon. It was not as the wind said. I cursed Vīraka falsely
when I was overcome by anger; fools who are filled with anger often do
what should not be done. Anger destroys fame; anger destroys established
wealth; and people whose perception of their goals is perverted easily
find misfortune. Without uncovering all the truth, I cursed my son.'
Then the daughter of the mountain lowered her face which had skin like a
lotus and was contorted with shame, and she said to Vīraka, ‘Vīraka, I
am your mother; do not be confused or mistaken in your mind. I am the
beloved of Śaṅkara, daughter of the mountain Himālaya. Do not doubt me,
my son, or be misled by the appearance of my limbs: the lotus-born god
was satisfied with me and gave me this goldenness. I cursed you when I
did not know what had occurred with the demon, for I knew only that a
woman had entered into the private apartments of Śaṅkara. I cannot turn
back my curse, Vīraka, but I will say that you will be reborn in a human
female named “Rock”, engendered by a man named
Śilāda,^{<<chapter6.html_ipg260_fn30>>[[#page_260.html#pg260_fn30][30]]}
in the sacred Arbuda forest which gives men release for heaven. There is
situated the /liṅga/ of the lord of mountains
<<chapter6.html_page_261>>whose rewards for men are equal to those of
the Viśvanātha in Benares... When you have propitiated the lord Bhava
there, you will obtain from him the name of Nandin, and you will soon
come here and become the guardian of the door.'

When Vīraka heard this, his hair stood on end with delight, and he
prostrated himself before her and praised her, his mother, with various
speeches: ‘O Goddess, I am fortunate to have obtained the state of being
a man, which is very hard to obtain. Your curse is a favour, especially
as it will take place on the Arbuda mountain at the holy confluence of
the earth and the ocean, above the earth, between the mountain and the
ocean. I will go there and find great merit by my devotion to Bhava and
then I will come back here, mother.' And when he said this, he became
the son of ‘Rock'.

The Goddess then entered the palace of the god who bears the moon as his
diadem. When the three-eyed god saw her he said, ‘Damn women,' and she
bowed to him and said, ‘You have spoken truly, and not falsely. This
portion of Nature is senseless; women deserve to be reviled. It is the
grace of men which brings release from the ocean of existence.' Then
Hara rejoiced and said to her, ‘Now you are worthy, and I will give you
a son who will bring renown to you who are fair and glorious.' Hara, the
abode of various wonders, then made love with the Goddess... [and Skanda
was born.]

*Devī persuades Śiva to let her create a son, Gaņeśa*

Śiva and Pārvatī frequently quarrel about their children, who serve to
separate rather than to unite the couple; just as Skanda is born of
Śiva's seed without any true participation on the part of Pārvatī, so
Gaņeśa is born of Pārvatī alone; and just as she stations Vīraka at
<<chapter6.html_page_262>>Śiva's door to prevent Śiva from making love
to other women, so she often stations Gaņeśa at her own bedroom door to
keep Śiva out. The sexual antagonism between Śiva and Gaņeśa is thinly
veiled in the present myth, but the pattern indicates clearly that Śiva
treats his ‘son' as he treats his other sexual opponents -- Kāma (by
burning him with his eye), Brahmā (by beheading him with a touch of his
hand) and Dakṣa (by replacing his head with that of an animal).

This antagonism is explicit in other myths, when Śiva mutilates Gaņeśa
(because Pārvatī has admired Gaņeśa's handsome body) or actually
castrates him, and it gains momentum from another corpus of myths in
which Śiva slaughters an elephant demon and drapes the skin around his
own shoulders. Here it is Nandin (sometimes represented as a bull, or
with the head of a bull) who kills the elephant, by fighting with Indra
just as Skanda does, and the more basic competition between Indra and
Śiva himself is evident from the fact that the two gods share the emblem
of the bull.

Another level of sexual antagonism exists between Śiva and Pārvatī: as
he is the god of ascetics he is free of passion and wants no attachment
to children, yet as the god of the phallus, and as her husband, he is
forced to make love to her and, ultimately, to produce a child -- though
he does so unwillingly and by unnatural means.

[Jaimini^{<<chapter6.html_ipg262_fn31>>[[#page_262.html#pg262_fn31][31]]}
said,] This whole universe is filled everywhere with the descendants of
Brahmā and Viṣņu; tell me about the descendants of Śiva. [The sage
replied,] Śiva is man and Pārvatī is woman; they are the causes of
creation. All men have Śiva as their soul, and all women are Pārvatī.
Śiva has the form of the male sign [/liṅga/], and the Goddess has the
form of the female sign [/yoni/]; the universe, moving and still, has
the form of the sign of Śiva and the Goddess. Thus this whole universe
consists of Śiva's descendants and has Śiva for its soul, but Śiva has
no separate descendants such as you are asking about, Jaimini...

<<chapter6.html_page_263>>Once, long ago, the daughter of the mountain
made a request of Śaṅkara, who gives peace to the world; for she wished
to have progeny even though, being the Goddess, she dwells in all
progeny. She said, ‘No rituals are performed for a man who has no
descendants;^{<<chapter6.html_ipg263_fn32>>[[#page_263.html#pg263_fn32][32]]}
therefore you should have descendants to follow you. Unite with me this
very day and beget a natural son.' When Śaṅkara, who gives peace to the
world, heard what the daughter of the king of the mountains said, he
murmured honeyed words to her, saying, ‘Daughter of the mountain, I am
not a householder, and I have no use for a son. The wicked circle of the
gods presented you to me as a wife, but a wife is certainly the greatest
fetter for a man who is free of passion; moreover, dear lady, progeny
are described as a noose and a stake. Now, householders have need of a
son and of wealth, and a wife is useful for a son, and sons are useful
to give oblations to the ancestors. But I have no death, Goddess, and so
I have no use for a son. Where there is no disease, what need is there
for medicinal herbs? You are woman, and I am man; let us enjoy being the
two causes from which progeny arise and rejoice in the pleasures of men
and women; without progeny, let us always sport, taking pleasure in
ourselves.'

Pārvatī said, ‘Lord god of gods, blue-necked, three-eyed, what you have
said is indeed true, but nevertheless I do wish for a little child. When
you have begotten a child, you can do your yoga, great lord; I will
bring up the son and you can be a yogi quite properly. An excessive
yearning for the kiss of a son's mouth has arisen in me, and since you
took me as your wife then you should beget a child in me. If you wish,
your son will be averse to marriage, so that you will not have a son and
grandson and subsequent descendants.' When he heard this, the god became
angry; he arose from his seat and went away. Then the Goddess became sad
and brooded unhappily <<chapter6.html_page_264>>for a long time. Her two
friends, Jayā and Vijayā, who had been staying with her, went to assuage
Śiva's anger, and they won him over.

When Śaṅkara saw how sad the Goddess was, he said to her, ‘How can you
be so sad just because you lack a son, beautiful goddess? If you want to
kiss the face of a son all over, I will make a son for you; kiss him if
you yearn to do so.' As he said this, Śiva pulled at the gown of the
daughter of the mountain and made a son with that fabric, and then
Śaṅkara said, ‘Daughter of the mountain, take your son and kiss him as
much as you wish.' Pārvatī said, ‘How can this piece of cloth be the
source of a son for me? This is my red dress. Stop teasing me, great
lord Śiva; I do not have the mentality of a common beast. How shall I
rejoice in a son obtained by means of a piece of cloth?' But when she
had said this, the Goddess born of the mountain made the cloth into the
shape of a son, and she held him to her breast, brooding upon the
teasing words of her husband.

And when that cloth in the form of a son had touched the breast of the
Goddess, it came to life and fell from her breast, and it quivered and
quickened more and more. As she saw it quickening, Pārvatī cried out,
‘Live, live!', and she caressed it with the two lotuses which she held
in her hands as she spoke before Śiva. Then the boy came to life,
getting his life's breath at that very moment, and he made Pārvatī
rejoice as he cried out indistinctly, ‘Mama! Mama!' The Goddess took the
little boy and was filled with maternal love; she held him to her breast
and gave him her breasts to suck, and milk flowed from her breasts. As
the boy drank the milk, his lotus face broke into a smile, and he gazed
up at his mother's face and she kissed his face all over.

When she had embraced him for a moment, she gave the beautiful little
boy to her husband, the great lord, and said, ‘Husband, take my son. You
gave me this son when your <<chapter6.html_page_265>>heart was softened
by pity, and I want you too, Śaṅkara, to know how great is the
happiness of having a son.' When Śaṅkara heard what the Goddess had
said, he smiled a little and said to the daughter of the mountain, who
was now dearer to him, ‘Goddess, I gave you a son made out of cloth to
tease you, but he became a true son by your good fortune. What is this
miracle? Give him to me and let me see; he has indeed become a real son,
but his body was made out of cloth; whence did life enter it?' As he
said this, Śambhu, the lord of the mountain, took his son in his hands
and laid him down; he looked at him carefully and
minutely,^{<<chapter6.html_ipg265_fn33>>[[#page_265.html#pg265_fn33][33]]}
inspecting all his limbs with an acute scrutiny. But then, remembering
the flaw in his birth, Śaṅkara said to the goddess Pārvatī, ‘This son
of yours was born with an injury wrought by the planet of
suicides,^{<<chapter6.html_ipg265_fn34>>[[#page_265.html#pg265_fn34][34]]}
and therefore your son will not live for a long time, but in a very
short time an auspicious death will come to this short-lived son. The
death of one who has acquired virtues causes the greatest sorrow.' As
Śambhu, the maker of the child, said this, the boy's head, which was
pointing toward the north, fell from Śiva's hand.

When the little boy's head had fallen to the ground from her husband's
hand, Pārvatī was overcome with grief; she took up the boy whose head
had been cut off, and she wept copiously, crying out over and over, ‘My
little baby, my baby.' Śiva, astonished, took his son's head in his hand
and spoke to the goddess Pārvatī with honeyed words, saying,
<<chapter6.html_page_266>>‘Do not cry, lovely Pārvatī, though you grieve
for your son. There is no grief greater than the grief for a son,
nothing that so withers the soul. Therefore stop sorrowing for your son;
I will bring your son to life. Goddess, join this head onto his
shoulders.' The goddess Pārvatī joined that head on as he had told her
to do, but it did not join firmly. Then Śiva thought about this, and at
that very moment a disembodied voice in the sky said, ‘Śambhu, this head
of your boy has been injured by a harmful glance, and therefore your
little boy will not live with this head. Put the head of someone else
upon his shoulders and revive him. Since the boy was held in your hand
with his head facing north, therefore bring here the head of someone
facing north and join it to him.' When Śaṅkara heard this voice from
the sky, he consoled the Goddess and summoned Nandin and sent him on
this mission.

Nandin wandered over the triple universe and came to Amarāvatī, where he
saw Airāvata, the elephant of Indra, with his head facing north. When
the mighty Nandin saw Airāvata lying down facing
north,^{<<chapter6.html_ipg266_fn35>>[[#page_266.html#pg266_fn35][35]]}
he started to cut off his head, but the elephant began to trumpet and
roar, and Śakra came there with the other gods and said, ‘Who are you
who have come in this extraordinary form to kill the elephant? Who sent
you, and why do you carry a sword in your hand?' Nandin said, ‘I am
Nandin, the servant of Śiva, and I have come at Śiva's command. I will
take the head of Airāvata and give it to Śambhu. The head of Śiva's son,
who was facing north, fell from Śiva's hand because of his harmful fate,
and a voice from the sky said, “When the head of someone lying down
facing north is fastened to his body, I will give the son of Śiva a head
and bring him to life.” Therefore I will definitely cut off the head of
your king of elephants. If you wish to keep your own life's breath,
abandon your hope for <<chapter6.html_page_267>>Airāvata and go away,
for no one is better suited than your Airāvata to give life's breath to
the son of Śiva.'

When the great Indra heard this speech of Nandin, he became angry; he
summoned all the gods and replied to Nandin, ‘How can you, the minion of
Śambhu who lives in the wilderness, intend to cut up my elephant by
force when I, the king of the gods, am alive?' And as he said this,
Śakra took up a trident to kill Nandin, but Nandin attacked and reduced
that trident to ashes with a roar. Then Indra took up a mace and hurled
it violently, but Nandin took the mace playfully in his left hand,
saying, ‘Take your own mace, Indra,' and threw it at him. The mace fell
on Indra's chest, fracturing it painfully, and Indra reeled in agony. He
picked up another trident and hurled it at Nandin, but Nandin cut it
into three pieces with his sword. Then Indra took up his thunderbolt and
rushed again like the wind, and Nandin became even more horrible,
unbearably frightening.

At this moment, the powerful driver of Śakra's elephant brought
Airāvata, who was in rut, to Indra. The mighty Indra mounted the
elephant and took his thunderbolt in his hand; aided by the army of the
Maruts, he fought with Nandin. All the armies of the gods surrounded
him, with their bows in their hands, and they sent a rain of arrows down
upon the dreadful Nandin as clouds send rain down upon a great mountain
in the violent time of the monsoon. But Nandin, whose monstrous body was
as hard as a rock and marvellous to behold, withstood that rain of
arrows, repelling them with parries of his left hand, with his sharp
sword, and with fierce roaring snorts, stupefying them with his
terrifying body. Then, while the gods looked on, he cut off the head of
Airāvata, and the severed head of Airāvata fell to the ground when
Nandin had struck it off. The gods were bewildered by this marvel; they
cried out ‘Alas!' and did not move.

When Śiva heard of Nandin's deed of valour he embraced
<<chapter6.html_page_268>>him joyfully, and he placed the elephant head
on his son's shoulders, and the moment that the head was joined on, the
boy became surpassingly beautiful. The god was rather short and fat,
with the lotus face of a king of elephants; his face was bright as the
moon, red as a China rose. He had four arms and was adorned by bees
attracted by the perfume of his flowing ichor, and with his marvellous
three eyes he shone in Śiva's presence. All the gods came there and saw
the son of Śiva who had the auspicious head of the king of elephants,
and Śambhu held the boy to his breast. Then Brahmā and the other gods
anointed him, and Brahmā gave him names, calling him ‘Pot-bellied'. The
marvellous child shone [/rarāja/] in the midst of all the gods, and so
they said, ‘Let him be king [/rājā/] of the gods, worshipped before all
the gods.' Then Sarasvatī gave him a writing pen with coloured inks, and
Brahmā gave him a rosary of beads, and Indra gave him an elephant goad.
Padmavatī gave him a lotus, and Śiva gave him a tiger skin. Bṛhaspati
gave him a sacrificial thread, and the goddess Earth gave him a rat for
his vehicle.

Then all the sages praised the red son of Śiva, and Brahmā said,
‘Śambhu, this is your son; you are he, there is no doubt, and he will be
worshipped before all the gods except you, great lord, for you, great
lord, are to be honoured first and last. The great-armed one has become
the ruler of all the hosts [/gaņas/] of the gods, and he is ruler of
your hosts, too, and so let him be called Ruler-of-the-hosts [Gaņādhipa
or Gaņeśa]. Since he has the head of an elephant, let him be called
Elephant-headed [Gajānana]; and since, when Nandin performed his
marvellous deed and conquered Indra and struck the elephant, the tusk of
his head was broken, let him be called One-tusk [Ekadantaka]. Let him be
called
Heramba^{<<chapter6.html_ipg268_fn36>>[[#page_268.html#pg268_fn36][36]]}
<<chapter6.html_page_269>>and always have the form of a seed, and
because of his corpulence, Śiva, let this son of yours be called
Pot-bellied [Lambodara]. By merely thinking of him, all those who would
create obstacles become afraid, and so, Śaṅkara, let this son of yours
be called Lord-of-obstacles [Vighneśa]. Anyone undertaking a journey or
a worthy project should remember Gaņādhipa and his journey will be
fruitful, his undertaking successful in its outcome. Gaņādhipa is to be
honoured in all auspicious affairs, for when Gaņeśa is honoured, the
gods are honoured, and they will accomplish the affair.'

Brahmā said this and stopped, but Indra, grieving at the absence of
Airāvata, said to Śiva, ‘Greatest of gods, great god, three-eyed lord of
Pārvatī, lord of the triple universe, I bow to you. Your powerful
servant, Nandin, slew my elephant and in my ignorance I fought with him.
Forgive me, O god, great lord. It is said, “You should give even your
own head to one who begs”, but I did not wish to give my elephant's head
to him. Forgive me for that.' Then Śiva said, ‘Throw Airāvata, headless,
into the ocean, and you will obtain your king of elephants again when he
arises from the churning of the
ocean.^{<<chapter6.html_ipg269_fn37>>[[#page_269.html#pg269_fn37][37]]}
And since you gave Airāvata's head to my son, therefore I will also give
you an immortal bull.' When the god Indra, the son of Kaśyapa, heard
this, he went to heaven, and Brahmā and the other gods received the
veneration due to them and went to their own homes. Then the goddess
Pārvatī, rejoicing, cared for Gaņeśa, and Gaņeśa became a great yogi,
averse to worldly attachments, and all the sages assembled and praised
Gaņeśa... and went away again.

This, O Jaimini, is the meritorious story of the birth of Gaņeśa. But
there are no descendants of Śambhu, who is the very form of final
universal destruction. His other son, mentioned first, is Kārttikeya,
the youth [Kumāra]; he did not marry either, but kept his vow of
chastity [/kaumāra/].

GODS AND DEMONS
:PROPERTIES:

:CLASS: calibre1
:END:
The battle between gods and demons, the central theme of Hindu
mythology, sets the stage upon which all of the gods, from Indra to
Devī, play their roles. But many important myths depict the battle
directly, as a whole, the confrontation of massed forces, rather than
isolated episodes in which a supreme god conquers the supreme demon of
the moment. The battle lines are blurred by the lack of distinction
between gods and demons, who share not only their superhuman powers
(together with such tell-tale signs as an absence of sweating or
blinking) but also their anthropomorphic moral ambivalences. In terms of
cosmic symbolism, the battle may represent the conflict between light
and darkness, but in actual myths there is little to distinguish between
the two opposed forces. By definition, by status and official function,
the gods are ‘right' and right must triumph, but the nature of this
‘right' and the method of the triumph underwent major transformations in
the three broad periods of Hindu mythology. The heroic measures which
the Vedic gods employ came gradually to be superceded by treacherous
stratagems in the Epic period and finally, in the Purāņas, by outright
and elaborate deceptions which had been originally categorized as
‘demonic'.

The arbitrary nature of the distinction between gods and demons is
emphasized by the circular logic of one early myth: Prajāpati makes
<<chapter7.html_page_271>>the demons evil because they /are/ evil, and
he creates them out of darkness, but he then makes their substance into
night.^{<<chapter7.html_ipg271_fn1>>[[#page_271.html#pg271_fn1][1]]}
Moreover, it is said that -- presumably because the gods and demons are
in fact the same -- the battle between them -- particularly between
individuals -- is mere illusion, for all that they do is preordained.

Prajāpati was born to live for a thousand years. Just as one might see
in the distance the far shore of a river, so he saw the far shore of his
own life. He desired progeny, and so he sang hymns and exhausted
himself, and he placed the power to produce progeny in himself. From his
mouth he created the gods, and when the gods were created they entered
the sky [divam]; and this is why the gods are gods [/devas/], because
when they were created they entered the sky. And there was daylight
[/divā/] for him when he had created them, and this is why the gods are
gods, because there was daylight for him when he had created them. Then
with his downward breath he created the demons; when they were created
they entered this earth, and there was darkness for him when he had
created them. Then he knew that he had created evil, since darkness
appeared to him when he had created them. Then he pierced them with
evil, and it was because of this that they were overcome.

Therefore it is said, ‘The battle between gods and demons did not happen
as it is told in the narratives and histories, for Prajāpati pierced
them with evil and it was because of this that they were overcome.' And
so the sage has said, ‘You have not fought with anyone for a single day,
nor do you have any enemy, O bountiful one. Your battles which they tell
about are all magic illusion; you have fought no enemy today, nor in the
past.'^{<<chapter7.html_ipg271_fn2>>[[#page_271.html#pg271_fn2][2]]} The
daylight which had appeared for him <<chapter7.html_page_272>>when he
had created the gods he made into day; and the darkness which had
appeared for him when he had created the demons he made into night. And
they are day and night.

*THE GODS TRICK THE DEMONS INTO LEAVING THE SACRIFICE*

The problem of differentiation between ‘hateful fraternal enemies' and
the conflict which arises out of the separation of truth from falsehood
lead to certain logical circles in a myth in which the gods use deceit
as their weapon -- after renouncing falsehood. The strategy of deceit is
recommended by the earliest Indian textbook of political science -- the
/Arthaśāstra/ -- a source noted for the same cynical realism which
appears here: those who speak the truth grow weak and poor, while the
cunning flourish like a green bay tree... for a while.

The gods and the demons were both born from Prajāpati, and they both
wished to possess the inheritance from their father Prajāpati which
consisted of speech -- both truth and falsehood. Both of them spoke the
truth, and both of them spoke falsehood; and as they spoke alike, they
were alike. The gods then gave up falsehood and kept truth, and the
demons gave up truth and kept falsehood. Then truth which had been in
the demons saw this and said: ‘The gods have given up falsehood and
continued to keep truth. Very well, I will go there,' and it went to the
gods. And falsehood which had been in the gods saw this and said: ‘The
demons have given up truth and continued to keep falsehood. Very well, I
will go there,' and it went to the demons. The gods then spoke only
truth, and the demons spoke only falsehood. The gods, speaking truth
steadfastly, became weaker and poorer; and therefore whoever speaks
truth steadfastly becomes weaker and poorer, but in the end he
overcomes, as the gods overcame in the end. Then the demons, speaking
falsehood steadfastly, grew <<chapter7.html_page_273>>strong and rich
like salt
soil;^{<<chapter7.html_ipg273_fn3>>[[#page_273.html#pg273_fn3][3]]}
therefore one who speaks falsehood steadfastly grows strong and rich as
salt soil, but in the end he is overcome, for in the end the demons were
overcome...

The gods performed the animal sacrifice, and the demons learned about
this and arrived when the gods had performed part of it. When the gods
saw the demons they snatched up the sacrifice and did something else,
and the demons thought that the gods were doing something else and went
away again. When they had gone away, the gods spread out the third
sacrifice and completed it, and when they had completed it they obtained
the whole truth. Therefore the demons fell and therefore the gods
overcame and the demons were overcome. And whoever knows this overcomes
his own enemy, and his hateful fraternal enemy is overcome.

*** Epic mythology: the gods and demons churn the ocean to obtain ambrosia
:PROPERTIES:
:CLASS: calibre11
:END:
The churning of the ocean is the classic image of creation by means of
chaos -- the disruption of the serene primeval waters in order that all
the oppositional pairs may emerge and meet in creative conflict. In the
course of this process, the agents of the churning (the gods and demons)
become differentiated, for at first they are united in their task, but
then they are opposed. The basic symbolic dialectic is that of liquids,
the neutral water which is transmuted into various elixirs -- human
(milk), ritual (butter) and divine (mead, ambrosia, or
Soma)^{<<chapter7.html_ipg273_fn4>>[[#page_273.html#pg273_fn4][4]]} --
as well as into the reversal of all elixirs -- poison. According to
Hindu cosmology, the earth is ringed by several concentric oceans --
first the salt ocean, then oceans of sugar-cane juice, wine, clarified
butter, milk, whey, and fresh water. The gods here churn the first, the
salt <<chapter7.html_page_274>>ocean, and produce from it first milk,
then butter, then wine, then poison, and finally Soma. The ambrosia is
trapped in the neck of a beheaded demon, while the poison is kept in the
neck of Śiva -- who is so often associated with beheadings. The
structural force of this dialectic is so powerful that almost every
essential element of the myth is duplicated: the ambrosia itself is
obtained twice, and there are two snakes, two mountains, two eclipses,
and two rains -- one creative and one destructive.

There is a shining mountain named Meru, an unsurpassed mass of energy;
its blazing golden peaks outshine even the light of the sun. The gods
and Gandharvas frequent its glittering, gold-adorned slopes, but men who
abound in /adharma/ cannot approach that immeasurable mountain. Dreadful
beasts of prey wander over it and divine herbs
^{<<chapter7.html_ipg274_fn5>>[[#page_274.html#pg274_fn5][5]]}
illuminate it. The great mountain stands piercing the firmament with its
peak, and it is graced by trees and streams. It resounds with the
charming songs of various flocks of birds, but others cannot approach it
even in thought. Its magnificent slopes are studded with many gems, and
an infinity of magic wishing-trees grow there. The gods, who dwell in
heaven and are of great vigour, rich in ascetic powers, came together,
mounted its plateau, and sat there to take counsel in order to obtain
the ambrosia. While the gods were thinking and conferring together, the
god Nārāyaņa said to Brahmā, ‘Let the gods and demons churn the ocean
which is like a churning pot, and when the great ocean is churned there
will be ambrosia, and you will also obtain all the herbs and gems. Churn
the ocean, O gods, and you will find ambrosia in it.'

The tremendous mountain named Mandara is adorned with mountain peaks
like pointed clouds; it is covered with a net of vines, it rings with
the song of many birds, and it is crowded with tusked animals. Celestial
nymphs and gods and <<chapter7.html_page_275>>Kinnaras frequent it, and
it extends for eleven thousand leagues above the earth and as many
leagues below. All the bands of gods were unable to uproot it, and so
they came to Viṣņu and Brahmā and said, ‘Think of some perfect and
effective plan to uproot Mount Mandara for our welfare.' Viṣņu and
Brahmā agreed, and the potent serpent Ananta arose at Brahmā's behest
and was instructed by Nārāyaņa in the task. Then the mighty Ananta
forcibly uprooted that king of mountains with all its forests and
forest-dwellers, and the gods went with the mountain to the ocean and
said to him, ‘We will churn your water to obtain ambrosia.' The lord of
waters said, ‘Let me also have a share of it. I will bear the intense
agitation from the whirling of Mandara.' The gods and demons then said
to the king of tortoises, the supreme tortoise, ‘You are the one suited
to be the resting-place for this mountain.' The tortoise agreed, and
Indra placed the tip of the mountain on his back, fastening it tightly.
They made Mandara the churning-stick and the serpent Vāsuki the cord,
and they began to churn the ocean, the treasure of waters, for ambrosia.
The gods acted together with the demons, for they all wished for the
ambrosia.

The great demons grasped one end of the king of serpents, and all the
gods held him by the tail. Ananta and the blessed god Nārāyaņa would
lift the head of the serpent first from one side and then from the other
and throw it down again and again. As the gods vigorously hurled the
snake Vāsuki about, winds full of smoke and flame came out of his mouth
repeatedly, and these masses of smoke became clusters of clouds with
lightning, and they rained down upon the bands of gods who were
exhausted and over-heated from their exertions. Showers of flowers fell
down from the tip of the mountain peak, strewing garlands everywhere on
the gods and demons. Then a great roar, like the thunder of a great
cloud, came forth from the ocean as it was churned by the gods and
demons with Mount Mandara; for various water creatures,
<<chapter7.html_page_276>>crushed by the great mountain, were dying by
the hundreds in the salt water, and the mountain destroyed many kinds of
aquatic beings living in the subterranean levels of hell. The mountain
whirled about so that great trees filled with birds spun off and fell
from the mountain peak. As the trees were crushed against one another, a
fire born of their friction blazed forth into flames and enveloped Mount
Mandara, which looked like a dark cloud charged with lightning. The fire
burnt the elephants and lions who were driven out, and all the various
creatures there lost their life's breath. Then Indra, the best of
immortals, put out that burning fire everywhere with water from his
clouds. But the various saps exuded from the great trees and the juices
from many herbs flowed into the water of the ocean. And from these
juices, which had the essence of ambrosia, and from the exudation of
liquid gold mixed with the water, the gods obtained immortality. Then
the water of the ocean turned to milk as it became mixed with those
supreme juices, and from that milk there arose clarified butter.

The gods then said to Brahmā, the giver of boons, ‘We are terribly
tired, O Brahmā, all of us, and all the demons and supreme snakes, all
except for the god Nārāyaņa, but no ambrosia has come forth. We have
been churning this ocean for a long time.' Then Brahmā said to the god
Nārāyaņa, ‘Give them the strength, Viṣņu. You are our last resort.'
Viṣņu replied, ‘I grant strength to all who are engaged in this action.
Churn the ocean-pot all together; twirl Mount Mandara.' When they heard
the words of Nārāyaņa they became strong, and all together violently
stirred the milk of the great ocean once more. Then from the ocean there
arose Soma, the calm moon, with its cool rays, and the sun of a hundred
thousand rays. And immediately after this the goddess Śrī, dressed in
white, appeared from the clarified butter; then the goddess of wine;
then Uccaiḥśravas, the white horse <<chapter7.html_page_277>>of the
sun; and then came the divine, shining Kaustubha gem for the chest of
the blessed Nārāyaņa, blooming with rays, born of the ambrosia. And the
great elephant Airāvata, with his enormous body and his four white
tusks, came forth and was taken by the Wielder of the Thunderbolt.

But as they continued to churn excessively, the terrible Kālakūta poison
came forth and immediately enveloped the universe, blazing like a smoky
fire; the poison paralysed the triple world with the smell of its fumes.
The lord Śiva took the form of a sacred chant and held that poison in
his throat, and from that time forth he has been known as Blue-throated;
thus it is traditionally told. At the request of Brahmā and for the sake
of protecting all people, Śiva swallowed the poison, and from it there
arose the
Eldest,^{<<chapter7.html_ipg277_fn6>>[[#page_277.html#pg277_fn6][6]]}
her dark form adorned with every kind of gem.

When, Śrī, Wine, the moon, and the horse swift as thought had come
forth, the gods went on the path of the sun, the path that leads to
immortality. And then the magic tree and magic cow that grant the fruits
of all desires were born. At last, the god
Dhanvantari^{<<chapter7.html_ipg277_fn7>>[[#page_277.html#pg277_fn7][7]]}
came forth incarnate, holding a white pot in which the ambrosia was
contained. When the demons saw this marvel they let out a great roar for
the ambrosia, each crying, ‘It is mine!' Then the lord Nārāyaņa took the
form of
Mohinī^{<<chapter7.html_ipg277_fn8>>[[#page_277.html#pg277_fn8][8]]}, a
magic illusion of the marvellous body of a woman, and he went to the
demons. As their minds were bewitched, they gave the ambrosia to him in
his female form, for all the demons had their hearts set on her. The
goddess who was made of the illusion wrought by Nārāyaņa held the bowl
and gave it to the gods to drink, but although the demons were seated in
a row she did not give it to them to drink.

<<chapter7.html_page_278>>Then the demons began to scream and, arming
themselves with superb armour and various weapons, they attacked all the
gods together; it was then that the mighty Viṣņu, accompanied by Nara,
took the ambrosia from the demon chiefs. When all the bands of the gods
had obtained the ambrosia from Viṣņu, they drank it amid great
excitement and tumult. As the gods were drinking the ambrosia which they
so desired, a demon named Rāhu took the form of a god and began to
drink, but when the ambrosia had reached his throat, the moon and the
sun reported it, for they wished to help the gods, and the lord Viṣņu
took his discus and cut off the well-adorned head of that demon who was
drinking the ambrosia he had obtained by force. The great head of the
demon, which was like the peak of a mountain, fell to the earth as it
was cut off by the discus, and it shook the earth. The severed head rose
up to the sky, roaring terribly, but the headless torso of the demon
fell and split open the surface of the earth, causing a tremor
throughout the earth with its mountains, forests, and islands. Since
then there has been a deadly enmity between the head of Rāhu and the
moon and sun, and the immortal head swallows them up even today.

The lord Hari then gave up his incomparable female form and routed the
demons with various frightening weapons. Then a great battle began on
the shore of the salt ocean, the most terrible of all battles between
gods and demons. Sturdy, sharp darts, sharp-pointed javelins, and
various weapons fell by the thousands. Demons pierced by the discus
vomited forth quantities of blood; those wounded by knives, spears, and
maces fell to the ground. Heads adorned with burnished gold were cut off
by swords in the terrible battle and fell ceaselessly; great demons were
struck down, their bodies smeared with blood, and they lay like mountain
peaks crimson with mineral ores. Everywhere thousands of cries of
distress were heard, and the sun grew red with the blood of those who
<<chapter7.html_page_279>>were hacking at each other. As they struck at
one another in the battle with clubs of iron or gold, or fought at close
quarters with their fists, the noise seemed to touch the very heavens:
‘Cut!' ‘Break!' ‘Attack!' ‘Put them to flight!' ‘Advance!' These
terrible sounds were heard everywhere.

As the fierce, tumultuous battle raged, the two gods Nara and Nārāyaņa
entered the field. The lord Viṣņu looked at the divine bow of Nara and
thought of the discus that subdues demons. As soon as it was remembered,
the shining discus called Sudarśana (‘Beautiful') came from the sky; its
glory was immeasurable; it shone like the sun; its curved edge was
unblunted; it was terrifying, invincible, supreme, blazing like a fire
devouring the oblation, frightening, nimble, glorious, a destroyer of
hostile cities. The unfallen Viṣņu, whose arms were like elephant
trunks, threw it abruptly with great force; blazing like the fire of
doomsday, it fell swiftly again and again, hurled from the hand of the
best of men, piercing the demons by the thousands in battle. Sometimes
it blazed like fire, licking the demon armies with its tongues;
sometimes it cut them up violently as it was hurled through the sky;
then it would fall on the battleground and drink their blood as if it
were a flesh-eating Piśāca. But the mighty demons, still undaunted,
continued to harass the bands of the gods again and again by hurling
mountains, mounting to the sky by the thousands like clouds whose rain
has dispersed. And from the sky would fall terrifying great mountains
like clouds of various shapes, still bearing trees, the tips of their
peaks having broken off, roaring as they struck with great force against
one another. The earth with all its forests trembled as it was struck on
all sides by the fall of the great mountains, and on the battle-field
the warriors roared loudly and incessantly at one another.

Then Nara took his celestial bow and covered the heavens with his great,
gold-tipped, feathered arrows, shattering the
<<chapter7.html_page_280>>mountain peaks among the terrible bands of
demons. The great demons, hard pressed by the gods, entered the earth
and the salt ocean, for they saw Sudarśana raging angrily through the
sky like a blazing fire devouring oblations. Then the gods, who were
victorious, honoured Mount Mandara and placed it in its proper place,
and they returned home like water-bearing clouds, making the air and the
heavens resound on all sides with their thunderous shouts as they
rejoiced greatly and loudly. Then Indra the Shatterer of Armies and the
immortals gave the treasure of ambrosia to the diademed Viṣņu to guard
and keep very safe.

*** Purāņic mythology: the gods win the secret of immortality from the demons
:PROPERTIES:
:CLASS: calibre11
:END:
*THE VEDIC SOURCE: INDRA TRICKS ŚUṣŅA INTO GIVING UP THE AMBROSIA*

The myth of the theft of the ambrosia is an old Indo-European one; in
one of the earliest Indian instances of it, Indra himself becomes the
fire-bird^{<<chapter7.html_ipg280_fn9>>[[#page_280.html#pg280_fn9][9]]}
to steal the elixir. The demon from whom he steals it -- Śuṣņa, ‘the
Scorcher' -- appears in the /Ŗg Veda/ as a horned demon who lays eggs
and who releases the heavenly waters when Indra kills him. This is a
myth of conflict between two kinds of immortality: the demons pose a
threat to the gods, as well as to the normal flow of time and fate
itself, by reviving their dead, as they often do in Hindu
mythology;^{<<chapter7.html_ipg280_fn10>>[[#page_280.html#pg280_fn10][10]]}
the gods take the ambrosia from them and use it for the only immortality
which is natural and in order, even for the gods -- ‘a full life-span'.

The method which the gods use is one which arises naturally out of the
image of ambrosia as food: Indra tricks his enemy into swallowing him.
This episode is a reversal of the usual Indo-European stratagem of
eating a potentially immortal enemy, as Chronos tries to
<<chapter7.html_page_281>>eat Zeus and Śiva swallows Śukra. Yet the
reversal also has precedent: for Atreus is tricked into swallowing his
children, and Indra (though swallowed against his will) conquers Vṛtra
by causing him to yawn him out of his
mouth.^{<<chapter7.html_ipg281_fn11>>[[#page_281.html#pg281_fn11][11]]}
As the vomiting forth is almost always an immediate result of the
swallowing in all the Indian variants of the myth, the episode becomes
not a battle but a rite of passage; the initiate obtains immortality by
being swallowed, returning to the womb, gaining the secret of
immortality (or the substance, ambrosia), and being reborn from the
mouth of his enemy.

**** <<chapter7.html_myt73>>73. FROM THE /Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā/
:PROPERTIES:
:CLASS: calibre16
:END:
The gods and demons were prepared for war, but the ambrosia was among
the demons, in the demon Śuṣņa, who carried it within his mouth. Those
among the gods whom the demons killed remained dead but those among the
demons whom the gods killed Śuṣņa breathed upon with the ambrosia and
restored their life's breath. Indra learned that the ambrosia was among
the demons, in the demon Śuṣņa. He became a globule of honey and lay
upon the path, and Śuṣņa ate it up. Then Indra became a falcon and
stole the ambrosia out of his mouth. Therefore this is the most heroic
of birds, for he is one form of Indra. Whoever knows this bears the
ambrosia, and whomever he desires to make live, free of disease, him he
should swallow and breathe upon, for he breathes upon him with ambrosia.
And thus he lives for his full life-span and does not die before his
life-span is complete.

*THE EPIC EXPANSION: THE GODS SEND KACA, THE SON OF BŖHASPATI, TO LEARN
THE SECRET OF REVIVAL FROM SUKRA, GURU OF THE DEMONS*

In the /Mahābhārata/, the two antagonists are no longer warriors but
brahmins, the preceptors of the two opposed teams. Śuṣņa is replaced by
Śukra (also called Kāvya), guru of the demons, while Indra (who,
<<chapter7.html_page_282>>in the /Ŗg Veda/, is assisted by Aṅgiras and
his
descendants^{<<chapter7.html_ipg282_fn12>>[[#page_282.html#pg282_fn12][12]]}
and is given the epithet Bṛhaspati, ‘Lord of Sacred Speech') is
replaced by Bṛhaspati, now a separate figure, the guru of the gods.
Indeed, the bond which joins the two priests proves far stronger than
the gulf which separates the demons from the
gods.^{<<chapter7.html_ipg282_fn13>>[[#page_282.html#pg282_fn13][13]]}
In this expanded version, the victim is killed not once but several
times; here the secret of immortality is not the Vedic Soma of Indra but
the Brāhmaņa ritual formula of Bṛhaspati; nevertheless, Kaca is still
swallowed (in wine, a form of elixir like the honey or mead of the
earlier myth). The familiar expedient of sending a woman to steal the
Soma^{<<chapter7.html_ipg282_fn14>>[[#page_282.html#pg282_fn14][14]]} is
given a twist here, for the gods send a man to bewitch the demon's
daughter. As he wins the secret of immortality from her, the myth
follows the pattern of other tales of a mortal man and an immortal
woman;^{<<chapter7.html_ipg282_fn15>>[[#page_282.html#pg282_fn15][15]]}
and just as Jason rejects Medea when he has won the golden fleece, so
Kaca rejects Devayānī after achieving his purpose.

**** <<chapter7.html_myt74>>74. FSOM THE /Mahābhārata/
:PROPERTIES:
:CLASS: calibre16
:END:
Strife arose between the gods and the demons for the sovereignty of the
triple world, moving and still. In their desire for victory, the gods
chose the sage Bṛhaspati, the son of Aṅgiras, for their family priest
in the sacrifice, while the others chose Śukra, Kāvya Uśanas, and these
two brahmins were constantly in fierce competition with one another. Now
those demons whom the gods killed in battle Kāvya brought to life again
by using his magic power, and then they arose again and fought with the
gods. But those gods whom the demons killed in the vanguard Bṛhaspati
could not bring back to life, for, although he had a noble mind, he did
not know the magic of resuscitation which the heroic Kāvya knew.

<<chapter7.html_page_283>>Then the gods became very discouraged and
alarmed by fear of Kāvya Uśanas, and they approached Kaca, the eldest
son of Bṛhaspati, and said, ‘Be kind to us, who honour and love you.
Grant us your excellent assistance. Quickly steal away that magic which
dwells in the brahmin Śukra of immeasurable energy and you will share
the sacrifice with us. You can see, in the presence of the demon king
Vṛṣaparvan, the brahmin who protects the demons there and does not
protect those who are not demons. You, being young, can propitiate the
noble seer as well as his beloved daughter, Devayānī, by your character,
dexterity, and sweetness, and by your good behaviour and self-control,
but no one else knows how. And when Devayānī has been satisfied, you
will certainly obtain the magic knowledge' Kaca, the son of Bṛhaspati,
agreed to this, and when he had been honoured by the gods and was
hastened by them on his way, he went to Vṛṣaparvan.

There in the city of the king of the demons Kaca saw Śukra, and he said
to him, ‘I am the grandson of the sage Aṅgiras and the son of
Bṛhaspati. I am called Kaca; accept me as your pupil. I will practise
the supreme vow of a chaste student with you as my guru for a thousand
years; permit me, O brahmin'. Śukra said, ‘Kaca, you are welcome. I
grant your request. I will honour you who are worthy of honour, and let
Bṛhaspati be honoured
thus'^{<<chapter7.html_ipg283_fn16>>[[#page_283.html#pg283_fn16][16]]}
Kaca agreed and accepted that vow as instructed by Śukra Uśanas, the
seer's son. He accepted the period of the vow as it had been mentioned,
and he propitiated his teacher and Devayānī. The young man in the bloom
of youth tried constantly to win her over by singing and dancing and
playing music before her, and by meeting her frequently he satisfied
Devayānī. Thus he satisfied Devayānī, a young woman in the bloom of
youth, <<chapter7.html_page_284>>and he gave her flowers and fruits and
gifts, and the wanton Devayānī sang with him and secretly flirted with
the brahmin who was under a vow of chastity.

Five hundred years passed while Kaca was performing this vow in this
way, and then the demons found out about Kaca. They saw him guarding the
cows in a forest, all alone in seclusion, and spitefully they killed him
because they hated Bṛhaspati and because they wished to protect their
magic knowledge. When they had killed him, they cut him into pieces the
size of sesame seeds and gave him to the jackals. Then the cows returned
to their own home without their cow-herd, and when Devayānī saw the cows
returning from the forest without Kaca she said, at an appropriate
moment, ‘Father, you have not yet offered the oblation into the fire,
but the sun has set. My lord, the cows have returned without the
cow-herd, and Kaca is not to be seen. Evidently Kaca has been killed or
he has died, and I will not live without Kaca; I tell you truly,
father.' ‘I will revive the dead man with the words “Come here”,' said
Śukra. Then, using the magic of resuscitation, he summoned Kaca, and
when Kaca was summoned he appeared unharmed, because of the magic. When
the brahmin's daughter questioned him, he told her, ‘I had been killed.'

Then the demons pulverized Kaca and mixed him with the water of the
ocean, but when he had been gone for a long time the maiden reported
this to her father, and Kaca the son of the guru Bṛhaspati was summoned
again by the brahmin Śukra with his magic formula, and he returned again
and reported accurately all that had happened. Then he happened to go
again to fetch flowers, as Devayānī requested, and when the brahmin Kaca
went into the forest the demons saw him and killed him yet again and
burnt him to a powder, which the demons gave to the brahmin Śukra in
wine. The descendant of Bhṛgu drank the ashes of Kaca together with the
wine, <<chapter7.html_page_285>>but when the cows returned at sunset
without the cow-herd, Devayānī again said to her father, ‘Father, I sent
Kaca to fetch flowers, but he is not to be seen.' ‘My daughter,' said
Śukra, ‘Kaca the son of Bṛhaspati has become a ghost. Even when I
revived him with my magic he was killed. What can I do? Do not grieve,
Devayānī; do not weep. A woman like you should not grieve for a mortal.
All the gods and the entire universe bow before the inevitable
transformation when it comes to them.'

Devāyanī said, ‘His grandfather was the ancient Aṅgiras, and his father
was Bṛhaspati, rich in ascetic power -- how could I not grieve and weep
for the son and grandson of such sages? He is a chaste student, rich in
ascetic power, always upright and dextrous in the rituals. I will follow
the path of Kaca, father, and I will not eat, for the handsome Kaca is
dear to me.' Śukra answered, ‘Surely the demons hate me, for they are
destroying my unoffending student. By this undertaking the fierce demons
wish to make me cease to be a brahmin. But what end would there be for
this evil? For brahminicide would burn anyone, even Indra.' At the
urging of Devayānī, the great sage Kāvya again summoned Bṛhaspati's son
Kaca with a great effort. When Kaca was summoned by the magic formula he
answered his guru carefully, from within Śukra's stomach, for he was
afraid for him. Then Śukra asked Kaca, ‘By what path did you enter my
stomach? Tell me, O brahmin.'

Kaca replied, ‘By your favour, my memory has not left me, and I can
remember all that happened. I am able to bear this hideous anguish by
thinking, “Let not my ascetic power be destroyed in this way.” The
demons killed me and burnt me and pulverized me and gave me to you in
the wine, Kāvya. How can the magic power of illusion of the demons
surpass that of brahmins, as long as you remain?'

Śukra said, ‘Devayānī, my child, what can I do to please
<<chapter7.html_page_286>>you now? Kaca could live only through my
death, for only by breaking through my belly, and in no other way, would
he be seen again.' ‘Both of these sorrows burn me like fire,' said
Devayānī, ‘Kaca's destruction and your slaughter. If Kaca is destroyed
there is no peace for me, and if you are slaughtered I cannot live.'
‘Son of Bṛhaspati,' said Śukra to Kaca, ‘your beauty has succeeded,
since Devayānī is thus devoted to you, the devotee. Receive this magic
of revival today, if you are not Indra in the form of Kaca, for no one
other than a brahmin may return again alive from my stomach; therefore,
take this magic formula. Since you have become my son, brought to life
by me, so you must bring me to life, my son, when you have come out of
my body. Keep this promise sanctioned by /dharma/ when you have obtained
the magic from me, your guru.' When Kaca the handsome priest had
obtained the magic from his guru, he broke out of the right side of the
brahmin's belly and came forth like the moon on full-moon night at the
end of the bright half of the month. And when Kaca saw the pile of Vedic
knowledge which was the fallen dead man, he caused him too to arise.
Then, when Kaca had obtained the complete magic, he bowed to his guru
and said, ‘The guru is the giver of unsurpassed truth, the treasury of
the four-fold riches of knowledge, worthy of respect. Those who do not
respect him go to the bottomless evil worlds.'

When Kāvya Uśanas of great majesty saw the handsome Kaca whom he had
swallowed when he was confused by wine, he realized that he had been
deceived by drinking the wine so that he experienced a dreadful loss of
consciousness. Then he became apprehensive about the drinking of wine,
and he wished to do something for the welfare of priests; he arose in
fury and declared: ‘From this day forth, any brahmin who stupidly and in
confusion drinks wine will be bereft of /dharma/, guilty of
brahminicide, despised in this world and in the world beyond. Let all
good priests who listen to their gurus, and all
<<chapter7.html_page_287>>the gods, and all people heed this moral law
that I have established in all the world to set a standard for the
/dharma/ of priests'. When the incomparable, majestic treasury of
treasures of asceticism had said this, he summoned all the demons, whom
fate had made stupid, and he said to them, ‘I tell you, demons, you are
childish, for Kaca, who has fulfilled himself, will live with me; now
that he has obtained the valuable magic secret of resuscitation he is
equal in might to Brahmā; he has become one with the godhead.'

Kaca spent a thousand years living with his guru, and then he received
permission to leave, for he wished to go to the abode of the
thirty-three gods. But when he had fulfilled his vow and had been
dismissed by his guru and was setting out for the abode of the
thirty-three gods, Devayānī said to him, ‘Grandson of the sage Aṅgiras!
You shine forth by virtue of your behaviour, your noble birth, your
knowledge, your asceticism, and your self-control. Just as the famous
sage Aṅgiras is to be honoured by my father, so is Bṛhaspati even more
to be honoured and worshipped by me. Knowing this, you who are rich in
ascetic power should understand what I say. As I devoted myself to you
when you were performing your vow and under restraint, so you should be
devoted to me, who am devoted to you, now that you have obtained the
magic secret. Take my hand in the marriage ritual with the marriage
hymns.'

Kaca answered, ‘As I must worship and honour your blessed father, so
you, with your faultless body, are even more to be worshipped by me. You
are dearer to Śukra, the noble descendant of Bhṛgu, than his very
life's breath; as you are the daughter of my guru, you are to be
worshipped by me always according to /dharma/, good lady. Since Śukra,
your father, is to be honoured constantly by me -- for he is my guru --
so are you, Devayānī, and you should not speak to me like this.'
Devayānī said, ‘You are the son of the guru
<<chapter7.html_page_288>>Bṛhaspati,^{<<chapter7.html_ipg288_fn17>>[[#page_288.html#pg288_fn17][17]]}
but you are not the son of my father. Therefore you are to be honoured
and worshipped by me too, O best of twice-born
ones.^{<<chapter7.html_ipg288_fn18>>[[#page_288.html#pg288_fn18][18]]}
From the time when you were killed again and again by the demons, you
were pleased with me; you should remember that, Kaca, and know that my
devotion is supreme in friendship and in passion. You who know /dharma/
should not abandon a woman who is devoted to you and has not offended
you.'

Kaca replied, ‘Though you have performed a virtuous vow, you are asking
me to engage in an improper act of union. Forgive me, fair lady with
lovely brows; I respect you even more than I respect my guru. Wide-eyed,
moon-faced, proud lady, I lived where you lived, in the belly of Kāvya.
Therefore, by /dharma/ you are my sister, fair one, and you should not
talk to me in this way. There is no malice in me, good lady; I have
lived here happily and I will go now; I beg you, wish me an auspicious
journey and let me be remembered and spoken of without any obstacle to
/dharma/ in your heart. Propitiate my guru constantly and
conscientiously.' ‘If you refuse me,' said Devayānī, ‘when I urge you in
a matter conducive to desire, profit, and
/dharma/,^{<<chapter7.html_ipg288_fn19>>[[#page_288.html#pg288_fn19][19]]}
your magic knowledge will not be successful.'

Kaca said, ‘I am refusing you not because of any fault but rather
because you are my guru's daughter. My guru gave me promission to
depart; curse me as much as you like, but I speak the /dharma/ of sages,
Devayānī. You cursed me today because of desire and not because of
/dharma/, for I do not deserve your curse; therefore your desire will
never be granted; no <<chapter7.html_page_289>>sage's son will ever tale
your hand in marriage. Since you said to me, “Your magic knowledge will
not bear fruit,” it will be so, but the magic will bear fruit for him to
whom I teach it.'

When Kaca, the best of the twice-born, had said this to Devayānī, he
went quickly to the abode of the lord of the thirty-three gods. The
gods, led by Indra, rejoiced when they saw him arrive; they honoured
Bṛhaspati and said to Kaca, ‘Since you have performed a most wonderful
act for our welfare, your fame will never die, and you will enjoy a
share of the sacrifice with us.'

*THE PURĀŅIC MYTH: BŖHASPATI TRICKS ŚURRA AND CORRUPTS THE DEMONS*

The Purāņa version of the myth employs the more traditional allocation
of sexual roles, and the gods send a woman (the daughter of Indra)
instead of a man (the son of Bṛhaspati) to seduce the demons and take
the secret of resuscitation from them. Since the daughter of the guru of
the demons is no longer necessary in this version, she is replaced by
the mother of the guru of the demons, a figure vaguely foreshadowed in

it is then she, instead of Kaca, who is magically revived in a typical
episode of beheading and
restoration,^{<<chapter7.html_ipg289_fn21>>[[#page_289.html#pg289_fn21][21]]}
while Śukra is eaten and revived by Śiva just as he himself ate and
revived Kaca (an episode to which he alludes).

The moral dilemma of the Epic (the daughter's poignant need to choose
between father and lover, a conflict which reappears in the myth of
Satī)^{<<chapter7.html_ipg289_fn22>>[[#page_289.html#pg289_fn22][22]]}
is here reversed when Indra kills Śukra's mother; and Śukra's daughter
imperilled him, while Indra's saves him from Śukra. But Indra's sin (in
which Viṣņu participates) is then made to account for the incarnations
of Viṣņu, one of which -- the Buddha--Jina
avatar^{<<chapter7.html_ipg289_fn23>>[[#page_289.html#pg289_fn23][23]]}
-- <<chapter7.html_page_290>>is incorporated here in full. This time the
heresy of the demons serves not as a mere technicality by which they are
disqualified from participation in the power struggle, a lapse which
robs them of their power, but as an actual philosophy of renunciation,
whose content is taken into account to explain the demons' voluntary
withdrawal from the battle scene. This apparently ideal solution cannot
endure, however, for the fight cannot end (certainly not with the demons
so sanctimoniously content), and the demon brahmin comes forth again to
re-enlighten his congregation, to renew the conflict, and to reactivate
chaos.

**** <<chapter7.html_myt75>>75. FROM THE /Padma Purāņa/
:PROPERTIES:
:CLASS: calibre16
:END:
At a time in the past when the triple world was safe in the sway of the
great Indra... the
sacrifice^{<<chapter7.html_ipg290_fn24>>[[#page_290.html#pg290_fn24][24]]}
deserted the demons and went to the gods. When the sacrifice had gone to
the gods, the demons, sons of Diti, said to Kāvya, ‘Our kingdom has been
taken away by the bountiful Indra, and the sacrifice has gone to the
gods. We are not able to stay here, and so we shall enter the
subterranean watery hell.' When Kāvya heard this he said to them,
soothing them with his words, for they were discouraged, ‘Do not fear,
demons. I will support you with my own energy. All the sacrificial
formulas and herbs which exist on earth are within me, but only a part
is with the gods. I will give all of this to you, for I have kept it for
your sake.' But when the gods saw that the demons were supported by the
wise Kāvya, they all took counsel together in order to compete with
them. ‘This Kāvya is taking all of this universe from us by force,' they
said. ‘Very well, let us go quickly before he deposes us. We will attack
them by force, and we will cause the survivors to go to hell.' Then the
gods attacked the demons furiously, and as the demons were being
slaughtered they fled to Kāvya.

<<chapter7.html_page_291>>When Kāvya saw that they had been quickly put
to flight by the gods and were hard pressed by them, he drew them away
from the gods to protect them, and when the gods saw Kāvya standing
there they went away without hesitation. Then Kāvya thought deeply about
what Brahmā had
said,^{<<chapter7.html_ipg291_fn25>>[[#page_291.html#pg291_fn25][25]]}
and when he remembered what had happened before he said to them, ‘The
dwarf stole the entire triple world away from you in three steps; he
bound Bali, killed Jambha, and slew Virocana. The gods slew the great
demons in twelve battles; by many different methods the best of you have
been killed until only a few of you remain, and so I do not think there
should be a battle. I will devise a stratagem for you; wait until some
time has elapsed. I will go to the great god Śiva in order to obtain a
formula for victory, and when I have obtained irresistible spells from
the god Śiva, the great lord, you will again wage war against the gods
and then you will be victorious.'

The demons discussed this and Prahlāda, on their behalf, said to the
gods, ‘We have all laid down our weapons and are without our chariots,
unarmed and clothed in bark garments. We are going to practise
asceticism.' When the gods heard this speech of Prahlāda, uttered like
truth, they all turned back and went away, relieved of their fever and
rejoicing because the demons had laid down their arms. Kāvya said to the
demons, ‘Wait patiently for a little while, engaged in asceticism, for
time will accomplish your ends. Wait for me, demons, in my father's
hermitage.' When Kāvya had instructed the demons, he approached the
great god and said, ‘O god, I desire spells which Bṛhaspati does not
have, for the <<chapter7.html_page_292>>defeat of the gods and the
victory of the demons.' To this the god replied, ‘Son of Bhṛgu, perform
a vow inhaling thick smoke, head downwards, for a full thousand years,
and then you will obtain the spells.' Śukra, the son of Bhṛgu, touched
the two feet of the god in acceptance and said, ‘So be it. I will
perform the vow as you have instructed me, great lord.' When the sage
Kāvya, the son of Bhṛgu, was thus instructed by the god of gods, he
practised chastity of the welfare of the demons, in order to obtain the
spells from the great lord.

But when Śukra had departed, the royal gods learned that this had been
done as a mere stratagem, and so, happy to find this weak spot, all of
the gods led by Bṛhaspati attacked the demons indignantly, wearing
armour and bearing weapons. When the bands of demons saw that the gods
had taken up their weapons again, they all leaped up quickly, terrified,
and said, ‘We have laid down our arms, for our preceptor has undertaken
a vow. You gods granted us security, but now you have come here wishing
to kill us. We bear no grudges, and we have all abandoned our weapons.
We are clad in garments of bark and black antelope skin; we perform no
rituals and are without possessions.' Then they said to one another, ‘We
cannot defeat the gods in battle in any way, so let us, without a fight,
tell Kāvya's mother about this calamity and seek refuge with her until
our guru returns. And then, when Śukra has returned, we will put on our
armour and take up our weapons and fight.'

Then they went to Kāvya's mother for refuge, frightened, and she gave
them shelter, saying, ‘Do not fear, do not fear. Abandon your fear,
demons, for there is nothing for you to fear while you are in my
presence.' But even when the gods saw that the demons were under her
protection, they attacked them violently, not considering their
strengths and weaknesses. When she saw the demons being slaughtered by
the gods, the goddess became angry and said, ‘I will enchant the
<<chapter7.html_page_293>>gods with sleep.' Gathering together all the
requisites, she then spread a spell of sleep, and the goddess, who had
great powers of yoga and asceticism, paralysed Indra and immobilized
him. When the gods saw that Indra had been paralysed, stupefied, and
placed in her power, they ran away in terror, and after the massed gods
had gone, Viṣņu said to Indra, ‘Enter into me please, supreme god, and
I will carry you.'

The Shatterer of Cities entered into Viṣņu, and when the goddess saw
that he was protected by Viṣņu she became angry and said, ‘I will burn
you up by force, O bountiful one, together with Viṣņu, even while all
these creatures are looking. Let the power of my asceticism be seen.'
Then the two gods, Indra and Viṣņu, were overcome by fear, and Viṣņu
said to Indra, ‘How can we both get free?' ‘Kill her before she burns us
both, O lord,' said Indra. ‘I am particularly powerless; therefore you
must kill her quickly.' But as Viṣņu regarded her he realized the
problem involved in killing a woman, and the lord thought of his discus,
which came quickly to him. Viṣņu acted in haste, rashly, for he was
frightened, knowing the cruel act which the goddess wished to commit.
Furious and terrified, he took up his discus and cut off her head.

When the lord Bhṛgu saw this terrible slaughter of a woman, he became
angry, and he cursed Viṣņu for killing his wife, saying, ‘Since you who
know /dharma/ have slain a woman, who is not to be slain, therefore you
will be born among men seven times.' And because of this curse, Viṣņu
is born among men here again and again for the sake of the welfare of
the world when /dharma/ is destroyed. After Bhṛgu had said this to
Viṣņu, he himself took the head and placed it upon the body and took
her two hands and said, ‘Goddess, Viṣņu killed you and I revive you. If
I know /dharma/ fully and have also followed it fully, then by this
truth, if I speak the truth, may you come to life.' He sprinkled her
with cool water and said, <<chapter7.html_page_294>>‘Live!', and when he
had said this the goddess came to life. All creatures saw her arise as
if from sleep, and they cried, ‘Bravo! Well done!' on all sides, for it
was a great marvel to the gods looking on that the goddess was thus
restored by Bhṛgu.

When Indra saw that Bhṛgu had calmly brought his wife back to life
again, he could find no relief from his fear of Kāvya. Unable to sleep
at night, Indra, the chastiser of Pāka, kept brooding, wishing to devise
a treaty, and then he said to his daughter Jayantī, ‘This Kāvya is
practising a terrible vow in order that there should be no Indra. I am
therefore seriously alarmed by that wise sage. My wide-eyed daughter, go
and enchant Kāvya quickly and tirelessly with various services pleasant
to the heart. Propitiate him so that the twice-born one will be pleased
with you, my daughter. Go! You have been given to him. Make this effort
for my sake.' Jayantī accepted her father's command and went where Kāvya
was beginning to undertake his terrible asceticism. When the goddess saw
Kāvya inhaling thick smoke, head down, suspended over the great pit of
the sacrificial fire, exhausting himself, shunning any pillow like an
enemy, weak in condition, she treated Kāvya as her father had told her
to. With pleasant words and sweet speech she praised him; she massaged
his limbs for long periods and presented him with balms soothing to the
skin; she served him for many years with things suitable for one
performing a vow.

When the awesome thousand-year vow of smoke was completed, Śiva became
pleased and offered Kāvya a boon, saying, ‘You alone have fulfilled this
vow, and no one else. Therefore you alone will surpass all the gods in
asceticism, intelligence, learning, self-control, and vitality. I will
give all the knowledge that I have to you, O brahmin, delight of Bhṛgu,
but you must not tell it to anyone. But what use is talk? You will be
invincible.' After Bhava had given this boon
<<chapter7.html_page_295>>to the son of Bhṛgu, he gave him lordship
over creatures, lordship over wealth, and invincibility. When Kāvya had
obtained these boons, the hair on his body stood on end with joy, and
the seer spoke to the lord of gods, the blue and red lord, and he bowed
humbly, joining his palms together, and prostrated himself before him.

Then the god vanished, and Kāvya said to Jayantī, ‘Whose daughter are
you, O well-endowed one? Who are you that have suffered when I suffered?
Why do you rival me with your great asceticism? You have lovely hips and
a fine complexion, and I am pleased that you have attended me with such
devotion, attention, patience, and affection. What do you wish? What
desire has arisen in you who have such excellent buttocks? I will grant
it to you this very day, even if it should be very difficult to do.'
When she heard this she said to him, ‘By means of your ascetic power, O
brahmin, you should know exactly what I wish to have done.' Then he said
to her, seeing with his divine eye, ‘Passionate lady with excellent
hips, you wish to spend a hundred years with me, invisible to all
creatures; you wish for our union, goddess dark as a blue lotus, lady of
beautiful eyes, worthy of a boon. You may indeed choose this if these
are your wishes, sweet-speaking one. So be it: let us go to my house,
you fascinating creature.' And so Uśanas the son of Bhṛgu went home
with Jayantī and lived with that goddess for a hundred years, invisible
to all creatures because of his magic power of illusion, for he had
performed a difficult vow.

The sons of Diti learned that Śukra had achieved his purpose, and they
all rejoiced and went to his house to see him. But on arriving they did
not see their guru nor find any trace of him, for he was enveloped in
his magic power of illusion. Then they thought, ‘Our guru is not coming
today,' and they all went back to their own abodes, whence they had
come. All the bands of gods then went to Bṛhaspati the son of
<<chapter7.html_page_296>>Aṅgiras and said, ‘Go to the home of the
demons and delude their army and put them quickly in your own power.'
The wise one said to the gods, ‘I will go there and do that,' and he
went and put Prahlāda, the lord of the demons, in his power. He became
Śukra and stayed there performing the office of household priest for a
hundred years, until Uśanas returned.

When the demons saw Bṛhaspati in the assembly they said, ‘This is one
Uśanas, and here is a second one outside. This is most curious, and
there will be a fierce conflict here. What will people say when this
contradiction is revealed? And what will this guru of ours who stands in
the assembly say?' As the demons were murmuring in this way, Kāvya
arrived and saw Bṛhaspati sitting there in Kāvya's form. Then Kāvya
became angry and said, ‘Guru of the gods, why have you come here? You
are deluding my pupils, as is your custom. The fools do not recognize
me, for they have been thoroughly stupefied by your magic power of
illusion. It is not right for you, a brahmin, to corrupt someone else's
pupils. Go to the world of the gods and stay there, and you will be
following your /dharma./ Your son, Kaca, came here to be my pupil when
he wished to obtain the magic knowledge, and he was slain by the demon
chiefs. It is not right for you to come here.'

When he heard this speech, Bṛhaspati smiled again and again. ‘There are
thieves on earth who carry off the possessions of others,' he said, ‘but
I have never seen this kind, that steal forms and bodies. Brahminicide
arose formerly when Indra slew Vṛtra, and you covered it up with your
heretical materialist
doctrine.^{<<chapter7.html_ipg296_fn26>>[[#page_296.html#pg296_fn26][26]]}
I know you: you are Bṛhaspati, the preceptor of the gods, the son of
Aṅgiras, and you have come <<chapter7.html_page_297>>here in my form.
Let all of you demons see: this one has come here to delude you with the
machinations devised by Viṣņu. Therefore bind him in chains and throw
him into the salt ocean.' ‘/That/ one is the household priest of the
gods who dwell in heaven,' replied Śukra. ‘You demons who have been
fooled by him will be ruined. Look at me -- lord of demons, you have
been fooled by this evil one. Why have you abandoned me and made another
your household priest? This is the guru of the gods, Aṅgiras's son
Bṛhaspati, who has certainly deceived you for the benefit of those who
dwell in heaven. Abandon him, generous king, for he will carry victory
to the side of your enemies.

‘My lord, once long ago I set out because my pupils were in danger, and
the great god Śambhu swallowed me while I was staying in the midst of
the waters. I spent a hundred years in his stomach, and then I came out
of his stomach through his penis and was thereafter called Śukra
[‘Seed']. Then the god said to me, offering me a boon, “Śukra, choose
whatever boon you wish,” and I chose a boon from the god of gods, the
wielder of the Pināka bow: “Lord of gods, Śaṅkara, may the goals that I
think of in my mind and any other thing that I wish for become real by
your grace.” “So be it,” said the god, and he sent me to you. But
meanwhile^{<<chapter7.html_ipg297_fn27>>[[#page_297.html#pg297_fn27][27]]}
this other one, Bṛhaspati, became your household priest. Lord of
demons, king, I have told you the truth; heed it.'

Then Bṛhaspati said to Prahlāda, ‘I do not recognize this one as a god
or a demon or anyone else, O king. He has taken my form and come here in
order to deceive you.' At this all the demons cried out, ‘Bravo! Well
done! Let the former
one^{<<chapter7.html_ipg297_fn28>>[[#page_297.html#pg297_fn28][28]]} be
our household priest, whoever he really is. Do not let the
<<chapter7.html_page_298>>other one who has just arrived perform any
rituals for us. Let him go.' Then Kāvya cursed all the demon chiefs in
fury, saying, ‘Since you have abandoned me, therefore I will soon see
all of you deprived of your prosperity, deprived of your very life's
breath, miserable
mendicants.^{<<chapter7.html_ipg298_fn29>>[[#page_298.html#pg298_fn29][29]]}
Very soon you will experience this terrible misfortune.' And when he had
said this, Kāvya went away to an ascetic forest as he pleased.

When Śukra had gone, Bṛhaspati stayed there and protected the demons
for a while. But when a long time had passed, the demons all came
together and asked their ‘guru', ‘Grant us some sort of knowledge about
the worthless circle of rebirth so that we may obtain release here by
your favour, for you have kept your vow.' Then the guru of the gods, in
the form of Kāvya, the demons' guru, replied, ‘This is my own opinion,
as I have explained to you before. Let everyone together seize the
proper moment and become pure, and I will proclaim the knowledge to you,
demons, and grant you release. This sacred scripture of the Vedas, as it
is found in the /Ŗg, Yajur/, and /Sāma Vedas/, by the favour of fire
gives nothing but misery to creatures that breathe here. The sacrifice
and the oblation to the ancestors are performed by lowly people intent
upon the goals of this world. The customs of Vaiṣņavas and those
practised by the followers of Rudra are evil /dharmas/, for they are
generally performed by these people together with their wives and they
involve taking
life.^{<<chapter7.html_ipg298_fn30>>[[#page_298.html#pg298_fn30][30]]}

‘How could Rudra, the lord who is half
woman,^{<<chapter7.html_ipg298_fn31>>[[#page_298.html#pg298_fn31][31]]}
find release, <<chapter7.html_page_299>>surrounded as he is by bands of
ghosts and adorned by bones?... Lord of demons, how will people go to
heaven by means of sexual intercourse? Where purification is obtained by
means of dirt and ashes, what purification can there be? O demon, see
how perverse this world is, which purifies the penis and anus which emit
urine and faeces... Once, in the past, Soma carried off Tārā, the wife
of Bṛhaspati, and
Budha^{<<chapter7.html_ipg299_fn32>>[[#page_299.html#pg299_fn32][32]]}
was the son born in her; and yet the guru Brhaspati took her back
again.^{<<chapter7.html_ipg299_fn33>>[[#page_299.html#pg299_fn33][33]]}
Ahalyā, the wife of the sage Gautama, was taken by Śakra
himself;^{<<chapter7.html_ipg299_fn34>>[[#page_299.html#pg299_fn34][34]]}
see what kind of /dharma/ this is. And other adultery like this is seen
in the universe; where there is this sort of /dharma/ what can be
considered the highest goal? Tell me that, O king of demons, tell me,
and I will tell you more.'

When they heard their ‘guru' rambling on in this way about the highest
goal, they became eager for it and were freed from attachment to the
ocean of existence. The demons said, ‘Guru, as we stand here full of
devotion consecrate us all so that, by your instruction, we will never
again be deluded. We are quite free of attachment to the circle of
rebirth which brings sorrow a thousandfold; lift us all up, guru, as if
lifting us out of a well by dragging us by the hair. What god can we go
to for refuge? O best of brahmins, noble one, reveal the divinity to us
who have come to you. By remembering and fasting and meditating, by
worship and offerings, one obtains final beatitude. We are free of
attachment and will not be bound again by the cares and duties of family
life.' When the <<chapter7.html_page_300>>disguised ‘guru' was thus
addressed by those who were like bulls among the demons, he considered,
‘How will I do what is to be done? How can I make them into evil ones
who dwell in hell? A deception will place them beyond the pale of the
Vedas and make them the subject of ridicule in the triple world.'

[He summons Viṣņu, who appears as the great deluder twice, first naked
(as a Jain) and then in red garments (a Buddhist), and makes the demons
into Jains and
Buddhists.]^{<<chapter7.html_ipg300_fn35>>[[#page_300.html#pg300_fn35][35]]}

Then Bṛhaspati went to the world of the gods and told those who dwell
in heaven all that had been done to the demons. The gods then went to
the Narmadā river and saw the demons there without
Prahlāda,^{<<chapter7.html_ipg300_fn36>>[[#page_300.html#pg300_fn36][36]]}
and the king of the gods rejoiced and said to Namuci and all the other
demons, ‘Demon kings, formerly you held sovereignty over the triple
world. How is it that you have now undertaken a vow which totally
violates the Vedas -- going naked, with bald heads, carrying
begging-bowls, waving peacock fans?' The demons answered, ‘We have
abandoned our entire demon nature and have engaged in the /dharma/ of
sages. We preach all that increases /dharma/ among all people. Enjoy the
entire sovereignty over the triple world, Śakra, and go away.' The
bountiful one agreed to this, and went back to the triple world. Thus
all the supreme demons were fooled by the guru of the gods, and they
went to the Narmadā river. But when Śukra enlightened them all, they
awakened from their vow and once again they set their cruel hearts upon
taking away the triple world...

illusion (derived from the same verbal root as that of Maya's name --
‘to make') is /māyā/, a feminine noun often personified as a goddess.

<<page_37.html>>

<<page_37.html_pg37_fn22>>[[#chapter1.html#ipg37_fn22][22]]. Death is
usually personified as male (Yama or simply Death -- Mṛtyu -- as a
masculine noun), but nouns ending in ‘u' may also be feminine, and
occasionally, as here, Death is female.

<<page_37.html_pg37_fn23>>[[#chapter1.html#ipg37_fn23][23]]. See below,
myth 36, p. [[#chapter4.html#page_123][123]].

<<page_39.html>>

<<page_39.html_pg39_fn25>>[[#chapter1.html#ipg39_fn25][25]]. Although
there are far more than thirty-three gods in the Hindu pantheon, they
are traditionally numbered at thirty-three, the ancient Vedic groups:
twelve Ādityas, eight Vasus, eleven Rudras, and two Aśvins.

<<page_39.html_pg39_fn26>>[[#chapter1.html#ipg39_fn26][26]]. There are
several different traditional ways of dividing the ‘community of
creatures'. What is probably meant here is gods, men, animals, and
inanimate objects; elsewhere, the division is into gods, demons,
ancestors, and men (see below, myth 9, p.
[[#chapter1.html#page_44][44]]) or serpents, birds, plants, and insects
(myth 10, p. [[#chapter1.html#page_47][47]]).

<<page_39.html_pg39_fn27>>[[#chapter1.html#ipg39_fn27][27]]. At the end
of each aeon or /kalpa/, the universe is burnt and flooded. See below,
myths [[#chapter4.html#myt38][38]], pp.
[[#chapter4.html#page_138][138--9]], and 50--51, pp.
[[#chapter5.html#page_180][180--84]].

<<page_40.html>>

<<page_40.html_pg40_fn28>>[[#chapter1.html#ipg40_fn28][28]]. To join the
palms together in the /‘añjali'/ or ‘handful of flowers' gesture is to
demonstrate reverence and supplication.

<<page_40.html_pg40_fn29>>[[#chapter1.html#ipg40_fn29][29]]. Yama rules
over the dead in hell. See below, myth 19, pp.
[[#chapter2.html#page_66][66--70]].

<<page_42.html>>

<<page_42.html_pg42_fn30>>[[#chapter1.html#ipg42_fn30][30]]. /Adharma/,
the violation of /dharma/, is behaviour which contradicts the natural
law of social order.

<<page_44.html>>

<<page_44.html_pg44_fn31>>[[#chapter1.html#ipg44_fn31][31]]. That is,
their status is determined by their past /karma./

<<page_45.html>>

<<page_45.html_pg45_fn32>>[[#chapter1.html#ipg45_fn32][32]]. A false
etymology based upon /gām dhayantas/, ‘speech-drinking' or ‘singing',
according to the commentator.

<<page_47.html>>

<<page_47.html_pg47_fn33>>[[#chapter1.html#ipg47_fn33][33]]. There are
said to have been fourteen different Manus each acting as progenitor in
a different era. The seventh Manu, progenitor of our present era, was
Manu the son of Vivasvat, the sun (see below, myth 19, pp.
[[#chapter2.html#page_66][66--70]]).

<<page_47.html_pg47_fn34>>[[#chapter1.html#ipg47_fn34][34]]. That is,
serpents, birds, plants, and insects.

<<page_47.html_pg47_fn35>>[[#chapter1.html#ipg47_fn35][35]]. A pun may
be intended, based upon the Sanskrit verb ‘you know' (/prajānītha/) and
the noun ‘progeny' (/prajā)./

<<page_48.html>>

<<page_48.html_pg48_fn36>>[[#chapter1.html#ipg48_fn36][36]]. Here
incarnate as a god.

<<page_49.html>>

<<page_49.html_pg49_fn37>>[[#chapter1.html#ipg49_fn37][37]]. The myth of
the Kṛttikās, Ṣaṣṭhī, and Kārttikeya appears below, myth 33, pp.
[[#chapter3.html#page_105][105--15]].

<<page_50.html>>

<<page_50.html_pg50_fn38>>[[#chapter1.html#ipg50_fn38][38]]. Sanaka,
Sānanda, Sanātana, and Sanatkumāra.

<<page_50.html_pg50_fn39>>[[#chapter1.html#ipg50_fn39][39]]. Or: who had
erections.

<<page_51.html>>

<<page_51.html_pg51_fn40>>[[#chapter1.html#ipg51_fn40][40]]. Dakṣa,
whose name is cognate with the Latin /dexter/, is appropriately born
from the /right/ side. The other sons preceding Dakṣa form one group of
the Seven Sages, and the four that follow (Kardama, Pañcaśikha, Voḍhu,
and Nārada) are famous Prajāpatis.

<<page_51.html_pg51_fn41>>[[#chapter1.html#ipg51_fn41][41]]. The Goose
(Haṃsa) and the Ascetic (Yati) are ancient sages.

<<page_53.html>>

<<page_53.html_pg53_fn42>>[[#chapter1.html#ipg53_fn42][42]]. See below,
myth 19, pp. [[#chapter2.html#page_66][66--70]].

<<page_54.html>>

<<page_54.html_pg54_fn43>>[[#chapter1.html#ipg54_fn43][43]]. The
al1-pervading godhead is /brahma/ (neuter). A pun may be intended with
the name of Brahmā (masculine), who here assumes a most un-metaphysical
role.

<<page_54.html_pg54_fn44>>[[#chapter1.html#ipg54_fn44][44]]. Each god
rides on an animal which is his ‘vehicle' in the metaphorical sense as
well -- his symbol, an animal in whose every instance the god is
implicitly present. Viṣņu (Hari) rides on the Garuḍa bird (see below,
myth 60, pp. [[#chapter5.html#page_222][222--3]]), Śiva on a bull (see
below, myth 69, pp. [[#chapter6.html#page_266][266--9]]), Indra on the
white elephant Airāvata (myth 69), GanĴeśa on a bandycoot (myth 69), and
the Goddess on a lion (myth 68, pp.
[[#chapter6.html#page_258][258--9]]).

<<page_54.html_pg54_fn45>>[[#chapter1.html#ipg54_fn45][45]]. The
/liṅga/ or phallus is the symbol of Śiva (see below, myths
[[#chapter4.html#myt38][38--40]], pp.
[[#chapter4.html#page_138][138--54]]). It is unclear whether Śiva is
here carrying this symbol or touching his own personal phallus; a pun
may be intended.

<<page_54.html_pg54_fn46>>[[#chapter1.html#ipg54_fn46][46]]. Eros, god
of desire.

<<page_58.html>>

<<page_58.html_pg58_fn1>>[[#chapter2.html#ipg58_fn1][1]]. Vṛtra is the
arch-enemy of Indra. See below, myths [[#chapter2.html#myt24][24--6]],

twelve Ādityas.

<<page_60.html_pg60_fn5>>[[#chapter2.html#ipg60_fn5][5]]. See above,
myths 3--6, pp. [[#chapter1.html#page_29][29--35]], and below, myth 34,

<<page_61.html>>

<<page_61.html_pg61_fn6>>[[#chapter2.html#ipg61_fn6][6]]. ‘They' refers
to the gods, according to Sāyaņa.

<<page_62.html>>

<<page_62.html_pg62_fn7>>[[#chapter2.html#ipg62_fn7][7]]. See above,
myth 3, pp. [[#chapter1.html#page_29][29--30]], and below, myths 33, pp.
[[#chapter3.html#page_108][108--10]], and 43, pp.
[[#chapter4.html#page_162][162--8]].

<<page_62.html_pg62_fn8>>[[#chapter2.html#ipg62_fn8][8]]. ‘He' may be
Yama, the sun, or Rudra. If it is Yama, then the ocean may be the
metaphorical ocean separating mortals from immortals, crossed by Yama in
this hymn; if ‘he' is the sun, the ocean may be the actual ocean crossed
by the sun every day; if he is Rudra, Yamī may be saying that Yama need
not fear Rudra, the punisher of incest, since he is absent across the
ocean.

<<page_63.html>>

<<page_63.html_pg63_fn9>>[[#chapter2.html#ipg63_fn9][9]]. This would
imply that his kinswoman, his sister, does not wish to become ‘alien' by
becoming his wife; an alternative translation would be: ‘that a woman of
another kind should become like him' -- that is, that an immortal woman
should become mortal like him.

<<page_63.html_pg63_fn10>>[[#chapter2.html#ipg63_fn10][10]]. The great
spirit may be Varuņa (the god who punishes sinful mortals and who sends
his thousand spies everywhere among mortals); or, as Sāyaņa suggests, he
may be Rudra, whose sons -- the Maruts -- Yama fears in spite of Yamī's
reassurance that Rudra himself is far away.

<<page_63.html_pg63_fn11>>[[#chapter2.html#ipg63_fn11][11]]. This is the
sun, born in the waters as Agni is born. The wife of the waters is
Saraņyū. Yama and Yamī are the children of Vivasvat (the sun) and
Saraņyū.

<<page_63.html_pg63_fn12>>[[#chapter2.html#ipg63_fn12][12]]. Mitra and
Varuna together represent the Indo-European duality of fire and water
and of earthly and spiritual power.

<<page_64.html>>

<<page_64.html_pg64_fn13>>[[#chapter2.html#ipg64_fn13][13]]. Or: Let
Yamī take upon herself the incest of Yama.

<<page_64.html_pg64_fn14>>[[#chapter2.html#ipg64_fn14][14]]. An
alternative interpretation of these last two verses might be: Let the
priest tend Agni day and night, as the eye of the sun dies repeatedly.
May the pair of twins, related as are heaven and earth, bear the
non-paired Agni. In later ages there will be races which will kindle the
non-paired Agni. Stretch out your arm to Agni; find another man than me
to produce the sacrificial fire.

<<page_65.html>>

<<page_65.html_pg65_fn15>>[[#chapter2.html#ipg65_fn15][15]]. See above,

<<page_69.html>>

<<page_69.html_pg69_fn18>>[[#chapter2.html#ipg69_fn18][18]]. Here he
sings a long hymn of praise to the sun.

<<page_69.html_pg69_fn19>>[[#chapter2.html#ipg69_fn19][19]]. The lord of
the dead is Yama, who has not yet been given this office.

<<page_69.html_pg69_fn20>>[[#chapter2.html#ipg69_fn20][20]]. Skanda is
the general of the gods. See below, myth 33, pp.
[[#chapter3.html#page_105][105--15]].

<<page_69.html_pg69_fn21>>[[#chapter2.html#ipg69_fn21][21]]. The word
used here for seed (/tejas/) also denotes energy; it is significant that
the sun's energy has just been compressed, made globular like a seed.

<<page_70.html>>

<<page_70.html_pg70_fn22>>[[#chapter2.html#ipg70_fn22][22]]. The
World-protectors are the guardians of the quarters, the regions or
directions of the sky: Indra, lord of the east; Yama, lord of the south;
Kubera, lord of the north; and Varuņa, lord of the west. In addition,
there are four gods of the intermediary directions: Agni (south-east),
the sun (south-west), the wind (north-west), and Soma (north-east).

<<page_72.html>>

<<page_72.html_pg72_fn23>>[[#chapter2.html#ipg72_fn23][23]]. Rasā may
here denote a river; in later Hinduism, it is the name of the
subterranean watery hell, abode of the demons. Clearly it acts, like the
Styx, to separate the other world from this world.

<<page_72.html_pg72_fn24>>[[#chapter2.html#ipg72_fn24][24]]. Pāka
(‘childish') is the name of a demon killed by Indra; the epithet may
thus mean ‘instructor of the childish' or ‘chastiser of Pāka'.

<<page_72.html_pg72_fn25>>[[#chapter2.html#ipg72_fn25][25]]. A reference
to /Ŗg Veda/ 10.108 (below, myth 23, pp.
[[#chapter2.html#page_73][73--4]]).

<<page_73.html>>

<<page_73.html_pg73_fn26>>[[#chapter2.html#ipg73_fn26][26]]. The Rasā
would, apparently, be ashamed to have it known that a dog had jumped
over it.

<<page_74.html>>

<<page_74.html_pg74_fn27>>[[#chapter2.html#ipg74_fn27][27]]. Here
Bṛhaspati is an epithet, ‘lord of sacred speech', applied to Indra. By
the time of the /Bṛhaddeuatā/ version of the myth (above, myth 22, pp.
[[#chapter2.html#page_72][72--3]]), Bṛhaspati and Indra had already
become separate figures. See below, myths
[[#chapter7.html#myt74][74--5]], pp.
[[#chapter7.html#page_282][282--300]].

<<page_75.html>>

<<page_75.html_pg75_fn28>>[[#chapter2.html#ipg75_fn28][28]]. Or: for
Manu.

(‘power') is the wife of Indra.

<<page_80.html>>

<<page_80.html_pg80_fn31>>[[#chapter2.html#ipg80_fn31][31]]. Before
uttering any imprecation, one would rinse his mouth.

<<page_80.html_pg80_fn32>>[[#chapter2.html#ipg80_fn32][32]]. This is
what Tvaṣṭṛ intends to say; but by misplacing the accent he
unwittingly creates one whom Indra will overpower.

<<page_82.html>>

<<page_82.html_pg82_fn33>>[[#chapter2.html#ipg82_fn33][33]]. The myth of
the three steps is told below, myths 47--9, pp.
[[#chapter5.html#page_176][176--9]]; the conquest of the demons in
battle is told in myth 72, pp. [[#chapter7.html#page_277][277--80]]; and

<<page_84.html>>

<<page_84.html_pg84_fn34>>[[#chapter2.html#ipg84_fn34][34]]. Evening,
when the sun is in the western realm of Varuņa (god of morality as well
as lord of the waters) is a time when truth must be spoken, a dangerous
time for Indra to violate a treaty. It is also the time when demons
become powerful. See above, myth 9, p. [[#chapter1.html#page_44][44]].

<<page_85.html>>

<<page_85.html_pg85_fn35>>[[#chapter2.html#ipg85_fn35][35]]. Indra is

great god thinks of anyone, that person immediately appears before him,
summoned and transported by telekinesis.

<<page_89.html>>

<<page_89.html_pg89_fn39>>[[#chapter2.html#ipg89_fn39][39]]. Or ‘let it
be diffused and scattered'. ‘Fever' here may indicate either Agni's
worry or the Fever of Brahminicide which will be diffused.

<<page_91.html>>

<<page_91.html_pg91_fn40>>[[#chapter2.html#ipg91_fn40][40]]. An
important race of demons, called Daityas, are the sons of Diti. Most of
them were slain at the time of the churning of the ocean (see below,
myth 72, pp. [[#chapter7.html#page_274][274--80]]).

<<page_92.html>>

<<page_92.html_pg92_fn41>>[[#chapter2.html#ipg92_fn41][41]]. In one
version of the myth of Indra and Ahalyā (below, myth 28, pp.
[[#chapter2.html#page_94][94--6]]), Indra is branded with the marks of a
thousand female organs (/yonis/), which are later changed into eyes.

<<page_92.html_pg92_fn42>>[[#chapter2.html#ipg92_fn42][42]]. That is,
she lay with her head pointing to the north, an impure position.

<<page_93.html>>

<<page_93.html_pg93_fn43>>[[#chapter2.html#ipg93_fn43][43]]. By saying
/‘Mā rudas'./ Rudra obtains his name in the same way (below, myth 36, p.
[[#chapter4.html#page_123][123]]).

<<page_94.html>>

<<page_94.html_pg94_fn44>>[[#chapter2.html#ipg94_fn44][44]]. See above,
myth 13, pp. [[#chapter2.html#page_56][56--7]].

<<page_94.html_pg94_fn45>>[[#chapter2.html#ipg94_fn45][45]]. It is the
duty of a Hindu to impregnate his wife during her fertile season, and
forest-dwellers who live with their wives are not supposed to have
intercourse with them at any other time.

<<page_96.html>>

<<page_96.html_pg96_fn46>>[[#chapter2.html#ipg96_fn46][46]]. Indra
prides himself on having performed a hundred horse sacrifices, both in
demonstration of his royal nature and to expiate his many sins.

<<page_98.html_pg98_fn4>>[[#chapter3.html#ipg98_fn4][4]]. Agni assumes
various forms in the sky (the sun), in the air (lightning, comets), and
on earth (sacrificial fire, domestic fire, and the digestive fire within
all men).

<<page_98.html_pg98_fn5>>[[#chapter3.html#ipg98_fn5][5]]. The Hotṛ is
the priest who recites the /Ŗg Veda/ at a sacrifice.

<<page_98.html_pg98_fn6>>[[#chapter3.html#ipg98_fn6][6]]. Or: a man.

clarified butter the share allotted to the waters, and make the
sacrificial victim the share allotted to the plants.

<<page_99.html_pg99_fn8>>[[#chapter3.html#ipg99_fn8][8]]. ‘Vaṣaṭ' is
the exclamation used when making an offering of an oblation to a deity
(in contrast with ‘Svāhā', used in making an oblation to all of the gods
together). See myths 5, pp. [[#chapter1.html#page_32][32--3]], and 33,

<<page_100.html>>

<<page_100.html_pg100_fn9>>[[#chapter3.html#ipg100_fn9][9]]. This may
mean that he removed his bodies from their hiding places.

<<page_100.html_pg100_fn10>>[[#chapter3.html#ipg100_fn10][10]]. The
fragrant resin is /guggulu/, or bdellium, used for perfume or medicine;
/tejana/ is a kind of bamboo; /avakā/ is a grass growing in marshy land.
/Kāśa (Saccharum spontaneum/) is used for mats and roofs; /kuśa/ grass

/aśvattha/ is the sacred fig tree.

<<page_103.html_pg103_fn15>>[[#chapter3.html#ipg103_fn15][15]]. The

reference to the four stages of life (/āśramas/): chaste student,
householder, forest-dweller, and ascetic. Although the sages refer to

<<page_144.html_pg144_fn43>>[[#chapter4.html#ipg144_fn43][43]]. The
three upper classes (priests, nobles, and commoners) are technically
twice-born, as they are ‘reborn' at the time of their consecration; but
‘twice-born' usually denotes only the brahmin class.

<<page_144.html_pg144_fn44>>[[#chapter4.html#ipg144_fn44][44]]. In this,
the sages follow the practice of yet another stage of life, that of the
forest-dwellers, combining the roles of householders and ascetics.

<<page_144.html_pg144_fn45>>[[#chapter4.html#ipg144_fn45][45]]. This
term is used to denote a position of sexual intercourse in which the
woman is on top of the man, but it may here imply nothing more specific
than general unchastity or perversions. The words of the sages are
contradictory and vague, betraying their lack of control or
understanding: they say that Śiva seduced their daughters, though in
fact it was their wives who followed him; they say that they castrated
him, though he himself did this, allowing them to think that this
happened as the result of their curse upon him.

<<page_145.html>>

<<page_145.html_pg145_fn46>>[[#chapter4.html#ipg145_fn46][46]]. The

in the sky', that is, naked; a term applied to Śaiva or Jain beggars.

with the active female element, Nature (/prakṛti/), which is composed
of the three strands or qualities.

<<page_148.html_pg148_fn57>>[[#chapter4.html#ipg148_fn57][57]]. A
reference to the Kāpālikas or skull-bearers, who wander about holding a
human skull in their hands, in imitation of Śiva's act of beheading
Brahmā and carrying Brahmā's skull to Benares.

<<page_150.html>>

<<page_150.html_pg150_fn60>>[[#chapter4.html#ipg150_fn60][60]]. Viṣņu
is here said to embody all of the third strand or quality, while Brahmā
and Śiva are made of passion and darkness. Compare the Śaiva attitude,
wherein Śiva embodies all three strands, though his antecedent Agni
predominates in the quality of darkness, while Brahmā and Viṣņu (‘forms
of Rudra') are still characterized by passion and goodness (see above,
myth 39, p. [[#chapter4.html#page_145][145]]), and myth 10, p.
[[#chapter1.html#page_50][50]].

of Viṣņu, ‘Descendant of Madhu' or ‘Vernal'.

<<page_156.html_pg156_fn64>>[[#chapter4.html#ipg156_fn64][64]]. There is
irony in this boast, for the irascible Durvāsas is an incarnation of
Śiva -- whom Kāma is about to attack in vain.

<<page_160.html>>

<<page_251.html_pg251_fn17>>[[#chapter6.html#ipg251_fn17][17]]. That is,
the act of self-immolation as Satī performed it; see myths 35--6, pp.
[[#chapter4.html#page_120][120--25]].

<<page_252.html>>

<<page_252.html_pg252_fn18>>[[#chapter6.html#ipg252_fn18][18]]. See
myths 43, p. [[#chapter4.html#page_164][164]], and 73, p.
[[#chapter7.html#page_281][281]].

<<page_252.html_pg252_fn19>>[[#chapter6.html#ipg252_fn19][19]]. See myth
60, pp. [[#chapter5.html#page_222][222--3]].

<<page_252.html_pg252_fn20>>[[#chapter6.html#ipg252_fn20][20]]. Śiva
wears the crescent moon as his diadem.

<<page_253.html>>

<<page_253.html_pg253_fn21>>[[#chapter6.html#ipg253_fn21][21]]. He is
‘uneven' because he has three eyes.

<<page_253.html_pg253_fn22>>[[#chapter6.html#ipg253_fn22][22]]. Mahākāla
may mean ‘the Great Death', or ‘Doomsday', or ‘the Great Black One'.

<<page_254.html>>

<<page_254.html_pg254_fn23>>[[#chapter6.html#ipg254_fn23][23]]. This
sentence depends upon a pun: /sneha/ can mean either ‘affection' or
‘oil', the latter the opposite of ashes.

<<page_254.html_pg254_fn24>>[[#chapter6.html#ipg254_fn24][24]]. ‘The
little hero', a name of Nandin, the guardian of Śiva's door.

<<page_258.html>>

<<page_258.html_pg258_fn25>>[[#chapter6.html#ipg258_fn25][25]]. This may
be a reference to one South Indian myth of Gaņeśa's birth: one day
Pārvatī saw the sacred syllable ‘Om', and her glance transformed it into
two coupling elephants, who gave birth to Gaņeśa and then resumed the
form of the syllable ‘Om'. Thus ‘Om' is Gaņeśa's syllable, and the rock
might be marked with this sign.

<<page_258.html_pg258_fn26>>[[#chapter6.html#ipg258_fn26][26]]. That is,
to commit suicide or ‘suttee'.

<<page_259.html>>

<<page_259.html_pg259_fn27>>[[#chapter6.html#ipg259_fn27][27]]. A
reference to the androgynous form of Śiva--Pārvatī.

<<page_259.html_pg259_fn28>>[[#chapter6.html#ipg259_fn28][28]].
Untouchables carry bells to warn approaching members of the higher
castes to avoid them. Śiva as the beggar who wanders through the Pine
Forest often has a bell tied to his leg (see above, myth 39, pp.
[[#chapter4.html#page_141][141--4]]).

<<page_259.html_pg259_fn29>>[[#chapter6.html#ipg259_fn29][29]]. ‘The
Sheath' -- that is, the outer layer of the Goddess.

<<page_260.html>>

<<page_260.html_pg260_fn30>>[[#chapter6.html#ipg260_fn30][30]]. As
Nandin is called Śailādi, two etymologies are offered here: that his
mother was a stone (/śilā/), or that his father was a man named Śilāda
(from which Śailādi would be the patronymic).

<<page_262.html>>

<<page_262.html_pg262_fn31>>[[#chapter6.html#ipg262_fn31][31]]. The name
of a narrator of this Purāņa.

<<page_263.html>>

<<page_263.html_pg263_fn32>>[[#chapter6.html#ipg263_fn32][32]]. The
oblations to the ancestors must be offered by a male heir.

<<page_265.html>>

<<page_265.html_pg265_fn33>>[[#chapter6.html#ipg265_fn33][33]]. It is
traditional to inspect a new born child to discover auspicious or
inauspicious signs indicative of his horoscope and fate.

<<page_265.html_pg265_fn34>>[[#chapter6.html#ipg265_fn34][34]]. The
planet of suicides is Saturn, Śanaiścara (‘He who moves slowly'). In
other versions of the myth of Gaņeśa's birth, all of the gods but Saturn
look at the child until, at Pārvatī's importunity, Saturn allows his
gaze to fall upon Gaņeśa, who is thereby beheaded. In this version,
however, it is obviously Śiva's evil eye that beheads Gaņeśa, though the
story-teller is unwilling to state this bluntly and makes an awkward
attempt to place the blame upon Saturn.

<<page_266.html>>

<<page_266.html_pg266_fn35>>[[#chapter6.html#ipg266_fn35][35]]. This
impure position makes him susceptible, as it makes Diti (myth 27, pp.
[[#chapter2.html#page_92][92--3]]).

<<page_268.html>>

<<page_268.html_pg268_fn36>>[[#chapter6.html#ipg268_fn36][36]]. Heramba
is a Dravidian loan-word meaning ‘buffalo'. It is unclear how this can
be connected with the Sanskrit word for one with the form of a seed
(/bījarūpa/).

<<page_269.html>>

<<page_269.html_pg269_fn37>>[[#chapter6.html#ipg269_fn37][37]]. See

from /Ŗg Veda/ 10.54.2.

<<page_273.html>>

<<page_273.html_pg273_fn3>>[[#chapter7.html#ipg273_fn3][3]]. Salt soil
is valued in a pastoral society, for cattle thrive on it.

<<page_273.html_pg273_fn4>>[[#chapter7.html#ipg273_fn4][4]]. For milk,
see above, myths 22--3, pp. [[#chapter2.html#page_72][72--4]], and 58,

the Eldest, is the goddess of misfortune.

<<page_277.html_pg277_fn7>>[[#chapter7.html#ipg277_fn7][7]]. The
physician of the gods.

<<page_277.html_pg277_fn8>>[[#chapter7.html#ipg277_fn8][8]]. ‘The
Enchantress', the supreme celestial nymph.

<<page_280.html>>

<<page_280.html_pg280_fn9>>[[#chapter7.html#ipg280_fn9][9]]. Even in the
/Ŗg Veda/, Indra is said to be ‘like a falcon' (see above, myth 24, p.
[[#chapter2.html#page_76][76]]).

<<page_280.html_pg280_fn10>>[[#chapter7.html#ipg280_fn10][10]]. See

above, myth 23, p. [[#chapter2.html#page_74][74]].

<<page_282.html_pg282_fn13>>[[#chapter7.html#ipg282_fn13][13]].
Similarly, in an early myth which already incorporates the motifs of
eating and transformation into birds, the demon Triśiras becomes the
priest of the gods to trick them (see above, myth 20, pp.
[[#chapter2.html#page_70][70--71]]).

<<page_282.html_pg282_fn14>>[[#chapter7.html#ipg282_fn14][14]]. See
above, myths 22--3, pp. [[#chapter2.html#page_72][72--4]], 65, pp.
[[#chapter6.html#page_242][242--7]], and 72, pp.
[[#chapter7.html#page_277][277--8]]. Viṣņu appears as Mohinī, Indra as
the female fire-bird.

<<page_282.html_pg282_fn15>>[[#chapter7.html#ipg282_fn15][15]]. See
above, myth 18, pp. [[#chapter2.html#page_62][62--5]].

<<page_283.html>>

<<page_283.html_pg283_fn16>>[[#chapter7.html#ipg283_fn16][16]]. That is,
when Bṛhaspati's son is honoured, honour will reflect upon the father.

<<page_288.html>>

<<page_288.html_pg288_fn17>>[[#chapter7.html#ipg288_fn17][17]]. Devayānī
and Kaca are in fact more closely related than she will admit, for Śukra
is the son of Bhṛgu, who is, like Aṅgiras, a son of Prajāpati; thus
Devayānī and Kaca have the same paternal great-grandfather.

<<page_288.html_pg288_fn18>>[[#chapter7.html#ipg288_fn18][18]]. Kaca is
twice-born because he is a brahmin, but he is also twice-born because of
his rebirth after the demons have killed him.

<<page_288.html_pg288_fn19>>[[#chapter7.html#ipg288_fn19][19]]. A
reference to the three original goals of life.

<<page_289.html>>

<<page_289.html_pg289_fn20>>[[#chapter7.html#ipg289_fn20][20]]. See
above, myth 24, p. [[#chapter2.html#page_75][75]].

<<page_289.html_pg289_fn21>>[[#chapter7.html#ipg289_fn21][21]]. Compare
the restorations in myths 36, pp. [[#chapter4.html#page_124][124--5]],
and 69, PP.266--8, above, and the revival through an act of truth in
myth 56, pp. [[#chapter5.html#page_201][201--3]], above.

<<page_289.html_pg289_fn22>>[[#chapter7.html#ipg289_fn22][22]]. See
above, myth 67, pp. [[#chapter6.html#page_250][250--51]].

<<page_289.html_pg289_fn23>>[[#chapter7.html#ipg289_fn23][23]]. See
above, myth 62, pp. [[#chapter5.html#page_232][232--5]].

<<page_290.html>>

<<page_290.html_pg290_fn24>>[[#chapter7.html#ipg290_fn24][24]].
According to another version of this story, in the /Matsya Purāņa/, it
is Śukra himself who leaves the demons and goes over to the gods (as
many demons defect), though he returns to the demons immediately.

<<page_291.html>>

<<page_291.html_pg291_fn25>>[[#chapter7.html#ipg291_fn25][25]]. This may
refer to one of the frequent instances in which Brahmā is forced to
promise that a particularly powerful demon will obtain certain
immunities, as Śukra is about to obtain from Śiva. The other text has a
different reading: ‘The brahmin Kāvya recalled what had happened
before...'

<<page_296.html>>

<<page_296.html_pg296_fn26>>[[#chapter7.html#ipg296_fn26][26]]. The most
notorious heresy in ancient India was that of the Materialists, called
Lokāyatikas here but often referred to as Bārha-spatyas, disciples of
Bṛhaspati, to whom their doctrine was often attributed. In view of
this, it is ironic that the true Bṛhaspati accuses Śukra of teaching
the doctrine that he himself (Bṛhaspati) has invented.

<<page_297.html>>

<<page_297.html_pg297_fn27>>[[#chapter7.html#ipg297_fn27][27]]. Śukra
himself seems to be confusing the boon given by Śiva long ago (when Śva
swallowed him) with the one he has just obtained (when Śukra swallowed
smoke).

<<page_297.html_pg297_fn28>>[[#chapter7.html#ipg297_fn28][28]].
Bṛhaspati, who had been there for the last hundred years.

<<page_298.html>>

<<page_298.html_pg298_fn29>>[[#chapter7.html#ipg298_fn29][29]]. The
demons are to become Jains and Buddhists, who beg for their food.

<<page_298.html_pg298_fn30>>[[#chapter7.html#ipg298_fn30][30]]. To
‘heretics', non-Hindus such as Jains, Buddhists, or Materialists, the
presence of women in Hindu rituals would suggest unchastity, while the
animal sacrifice would violate the Jain and Buddhist injunction against
taking life. These and other arguments that follow are traditional
‘heretic' criticisms of various Hindu sectarian practices.

<<page_298.html_pg298_fn31>>[[#chapter7.html#ipg298_fn31][31]]. A
reference to the androgyne. See above, myth 68, p.
[[#chapter6.html#page_259][259]].

<<page_299.html>>

<<page_299.html_pg299_fn32>>[[#chapter7.html#ipg299_fn32][32]]. Budha is
a king of the lunar dynasty, in no way related to Gautama the Buddha.

<<page_299.html_pg299_fn33>>[[#chapter7.html#ipg299_fn33][33]]. When
Tārā, the wife of Bṛhaspati, was raped by Soma, she gave birth to a son
by Soma, as she herself admitted, but was still restored to her husband
Bṛhaspati. Again, it is ironic that the true Bṛhaspati, in disguise,
tells this story to his own discredit, for a man of honour would have
rejected such a wife, as Rāma rejected Sītā in similar circumstances
(see above, myth 56, pp. [[#chapter5.html#page_198][198--200]]).

<<page_299.html_pg299_fn34>>[[#chapter7.html#ipg299_fn34][34]]. See
above, myth 28, pp. [[#chapter2.html#page_94][94--6]].

<<page_300.html>>

<<page_300.html_pg300_fn35>>[[#chapter7.html#ipg300_fn35][35]]. See
above, myth 62, pp. [[#chapter5.html#page_232][232--5]].

<<page_300.html_pg300_fn36>>[[#chapter7.html#ipg300_fn36][36]]. He
alone, the virtuous demon, resisted corruption by Bṛhaspati.

<<back1_split_002.html_page_313>>*Notes to the Text*

The exact Sanskrit source of each myth is given first, followed by a
list of other versions of the myth in alphabetical order of four groups:
Vedic, Brāhmaņic, Epic (where these exist), and Purāņic. Texts available
in translation are preceded by*, and references to secondary versions
are to translations. For the /Mahābhārata/, references are to the
critical edition, followed by Roy's translation (in brackets). These
lists are by no means exhaustive, but merely indicate a line for further
research. For some myths, interpretations and discussions are listed
after the Sanskrit sources; the reader should also bear in mind the
usefulness of many translators' notes.
