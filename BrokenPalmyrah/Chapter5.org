Chapter 5

THE GROWTH OF THE TAMIL MILITANCY

5.1 Post 1983

The aftermath of the 1983 race riots brought a flood of recruits into
the militant groups. The militant movements had become fractured in 1980
with the split between Prabhakaran and Uma Maheswaran. The latter went
on to found P.L.O.T.E. (Peoples Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam)
and the former the L.T.T.E. (Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam). India's
role in Sri Lanka's internal affairs assumed a new phase in 1981 when it
refused to deport to Sri Lanka Prabhakaran and Uma Maheswaran who had
got themselves locked up in police custody over a gun fight at Pondi
Bazaar. The Sri Lankan government claimed that they were wanted as
criminal suspects. After the 1983 riots all militant groups based
themselves in Tamil Nadu. The other significant militant groups are the
T.E.L.O., the E.P.R.L.F. and the E.R.O.S.. All of them received succour
from India and were monitored by the Indian intelligence organisation
R.A.W. (Research and Analysis Wing). By unofficial estimates 3,000
Tamils had been killed and the stock of the Sri Lankan government in
international opinion reached an all time low. India had also offered
its offices to reach a political settlement. Instead of cutting its
losses and reaching a settlement with the Tamils, the government first
agreed to proposals put forward by the Indian Special Envoy Mr. G.
Parthasarathy, and then dragged its feet. A Minister for National
Security was appointed in January 1984 it became evident that Mr.
Parthasarathy's proposals had been rejected in all but words. Many
Sinhalese critics of the government felt that it was fatally idiotic to
trifle with India in this manner. The government repeatedly claimed that
India was going to invade Sri Lanka. But to more perceptive observers at
that time, the possibility of invasion seemed very remote. While the
international press claimed that Tamil militants were receiving training
in India, India stated that there were only Tamil refugees on Indian
soil. The true situation became one of the open secrets of the day. In
consequence of all these, the result in Ceylon was a mounting military
campaign by the government which increasingly became a campaign of
indiscriminate terror. This was paralleled by an increasingly effective
Tamil insurgency.

5.2 The Militants in Politics

By the time of the cease-fire of 18 June 1985, the militants had reached
a dominant position in the Jaffna peninsula. Sri Lankan troops there
were confined to barracks. Militarily the T.E.L.O. had come to rival the
L.T.T.E.. The P.L.O.T.E. was well trained and armed, but claimed that it
was building up for military action rather than for a guerrilla
campaign. When the L.T.T.E., T.E.L.O., E.P.R.L.F. and E.R.O.S. formally
united a short time before in April 1985 to form the E.N.L.F. (Eelam
National Liberation Front), this gave a considerable morale boost to the
Tamil population. Up to this time the Tamil population had hardly
differentiated between rival groups. They were all referred to as boys
and even Tigers. A short time after the cease fire the people began to
realise that there were several disturbing trends. The formal unity of
the E.N.L.F. was a facade and the boys were not going to listen to the
people. About this time a novel, titled Puthiyathor Ulakam (A New
World), was published by a dissident group of the P.L.O.T.E.. The book
was about how young men with high ideals and a desire to sacrifice
themselves for the good of their people, were drawn into a militant
group which tried to pervert their original good intentions into a
bizarre totalitarian conformism. Those who would not fall in line were
tortured and brutally destroyed. Sources from this dissident group known
as the "spark" group, claimed that about 90 members of P.L.O.T.E. had
been so killed. There have also been a considerable number of
authenticated internal killings within the L.T.T.E. and T.E.L.O.
organisations. A large number of these killings took place on Indian
soil. People began to wonder if India was indeed committed to democracy,
justice and the well being of the Tamils. For what then had the police
in Tamil Nadu been doing all these days?

        Another reason why these groups were not accountable to the
people was that their dependence on the people was minimal. The people
were mainly demonstration fodder. During 1984 and in the first half of
1985 the Citizens' Committees had filled the gap left behind by the
self-exiled M.P.s. The committees were made up mainly of people of
standing and were independent of the militant groups. To them fell the
task of collecting information on army atrocities and making
representations to the army and the government. One of the tasks
performed by them was to make representations on behalf of the numerous
youths who were being detained. The Citizens' Committees earned for
themselves considerable credibility in the eyes of foreign journalists
and in those of several embassies. The first blow to the mood of
optimism which followed the ceasefire resulted from the murder by the
L.T.T.E. of Mr. C. Anandarajan, Principal of St. John's College, and a
leading member of the Jaffna Citizens' Committee. Many people acted in
the belief that they still had certain democratic rights. Senior
students at St. John's College went around putting up condolence
posters. One editor who editorially questioned the killing was taken
away and warned. The members of the Jaffna Citizens' Committee which
asked the schools to observe a day of mourning received visits where the
threatening undertone was clear. The main charge against Mr.
Anandarajan, was the trivial one of his having organised a cricket match
of Jaffna Schools versus the Sri Lankan Army, in the belief that it was
in the spirit of the cease fire. It may be noted that about 15 months
later in the middle of war leaders of the L.T.T.E. would fraternise on
T.V. screens with Sri Lankan army officers, of whom Captain Kotelawela
became well known.

        A little earlier Mr. Gnanachandran, A.G.A. (Assistant Government
Agent), Mullaitivu, had been assassinated and sixteen charges against
him were issued in a leaflet. A highly educated man who was close to the
L.T.T.E. gave the following extraordinary tale in justification of the
assassination: In 1985 the people of Mullaitivu went through a difficult
period due to Sri Lankan army action. The story went that Rajiv Gandhi
telephoned President J. R. Jayewardene to protest about problems in
Mullaitivu. President Jayewardene denied that such problems existed and
in support of his claim asked Rajiv Gandhi to talk directly to the man
on the spot and connected him on to A.G.A. Gnanachandran in Mullaitivu.
A.G.A. Gnanachandran is said to have backed the President's claim. When
asked how the militants got to know of this, the narrator of this story
was sure that the conversation must have been overheard by an office
employee at the switchboard who in turn would have informed the
L.T.T.E.. Jaffna had now descended to trial by leaflet, gun, speculation
and theatrics. The feeling of being besieged made the man in Jaffna
accept all rumours and innuendoes that furthered the "Tamil cause,"
without examination. A few felt that things had gone fatally wrong. But
most felt that the boys understandably made some small mistakes and that
they would come around.

        In another incident the army wanted all men in an area of Navaly
to report at their camp the following day. A militant group came later
and ordered that no one should go. Gunaratnam was a strong Jehovah's
witneess who felt that not to go after agreeing to do so was to have
told a deliberate lie. He maintained that since he had done nothing
wrong he should go and perhaps expound his religious convictions to the
soldiers. He did go. He was later interrogated by the militant group who
could not appreciate his point of view. He was then executed. His
agonised sister believes to this day that her brother is somewhere
alive.

        An example of trial by theatrics was the murder of a man
popularly known as Rajanikanth by the T.E.L.O.. A resident of
Kalviyankadu, he was an ironsmith who sometimes did some favours for the
T.E.L.O.. It is said that once he had seen some members of the T.E.L.O.
indulging in some unseemly behaviour with some girls. Rajanikanth
proceeded to scold them as boys would be scolded by an older man. Later
he was abducted by a faction of the T.E.L.O. and displayed on a stage at
Nelliady Junction. A T.E.L.O. member dressed up as a woman came on stage
and accused Rajanikanth of having raped her. The woman was given a knife
and was asked to mete out an appropriate punishment. Rajanikanth was
stabbed to death in a gruesome manner in public view. This happened
during the second quarter of 1986.

        Another phenomenon which came to Jaffna after the June 1985
cease fire was the prevalence of extortion and often very brutal
robberies. People's houses were broken into by armed men, and after
beating and sometimes torturing, their jewellery and other valuables
were taken away. Appeals were made editorially and by posters to the
militant groups to fulfil their obligation of policing, now that the Sri
Lankan army was confined to barracks. But no militant group came forward
to condemn these robberies or to do anything about them. Privately many
of them expressed the feeling that these things have to be done in a
liberation struggle to acquire resources. By several accounts, all
militant groups indulged in robberies. Different militant groups became
notorious in different areas. The game seemed to be to rob and try to
put the blame on another group. The T.E.L.O. was the most noted in
Jaffna town where the people were most articulate. This turned out to be
useful for the L.T.T.E.. It may be mentioned that the robbery at
Perumaal Temple in the heart of Jaffna, took place while an L.T.T.E.
sentry was at hand. People once more lived in terror.

        Although there was formal unity in the E.N.L.F. in response to
popular demand, they made no attempt to work together. It was well known
that Prabhakaran, the L.T.T.E. leader, and Sri Sabaratnam, the T.E.L.O.
leader hated each other. The assassination of T.U.L.F. M.P.s Mr.
Dharmalingam and Mr. Alalasunderam of 2 August, 1985, is an example of
the methods by which one militant group tried to score over the others.
Mr. Dharmalingam and Mr. Aalalasunderam were amongst the T.U.L.F. M.P.s
who continued to reside in Jaffna. On the basis of testimonies given by
several persons who had talked to T.E.L.O. exiles in India, it is
believed that this is how it happened: The L.T.T.E. leader Prabhakaran
reportedly made a strong threatening speech against the T.U.L.F.. Sri
Sabaratnam the T.E.L.O. leader then gave secret instructions to his men
to assassinate the two M.P.s expecting that Prabhakaran would get the
blame and the discredit.

        As expected the L.T.T.E. was largely blamed. In an independent
testimony, a P.L.O.T.E. sentry near Mr. Dharmalingam's residence
identified a vehicle in which the assassins came as belonging to the
T.E.L.O.. Another example of how the militant leaders functioned was
given by T.E.L.O. exiles. Sri Sabaratnam was a leader whose presence
gave a sense of awe to his men. Sometimes some members would complain to
him about difficulties such as conditions in the camp. Sri Sabaratnam
would listen with fatherly concern and go away promising redress. Later
others would come and beat up the person who complained and nothing
would change. Evidently the militant leaders had learnt a good deal from
the methods of their predecessors in parliamentary politics. Only their
adaptations were more frightening.

5.3 The Changing Character of the

         Militants

The 1977 riots together with the lack of progress on the parliamentary
front motivated many impressionable and able young men to look towards
the militant movement by the late 1970's. It was inevitable that the
University of Jaffna should become a focal point for leadership as well
as ideological direction. Many students became involved and several
members of the staff became active sympathisers. The risks involved were
considerable. In 1980 the University students put out a paper called the
Unarvu (Sensation) which was backed by the L.T.T.E.. The paper put
forward several Marxist slogans. The involvement of certain university
persons gave a mistaken impression that the L.T.T.E. was a Marxist
organisation. About the same time the faction of the Tigers which the
following year adopted the name of the P.L.O.T.E. started a paper with
the name Puthiya Paathai (New Path). This paper took a political line
critical of traditional parliamentary politics as well as of the hit and
run tactics of the L.T.T.E.. After two issues of the latter, Mr.
Sunderam, a prominent person in the P.L.O.T.E., was assassinated by the
L.T.T.E. while at the printers to bring out an issue of the paper. The
official reason given by the L.T.T.E. was that the members of the
organisation were signatories to a pledge not to leave the organisation
and join or start another - which Sunderam had breached. But other
observers say that Sunderam was a very able organiser and military man;
and Prabhakaran felt that allowing him to work outside his organisation
may create another rival to his own. This was the first internal killing
to surface publicly, although there had been several others before.
Following this two L.T.T.E. sympathisers Irai Kumaran and Umai Kumaran
were killed by the P.L.O.T.E.. Though people were alarmed, these
incidents were not taken to be a sign of a deeper malaise. By 1986 these
internal killings were to reach epidemic proportions.

        The students of the University contributed considerably to the
groups of the militant movement. The dedication of many of the students
was such that they left their academic careers and went to rural areas
and the Eastern Province to work for their organisations. Such persons
were by nature intelligent, sensitive and bound to insist on democratic
accountability from their leaders. With the rise of internal killings
and autocratic leadership, these students became disillusioned. By 1985
many of them started quitting their organisations to lead quiet lives.
According to the testimony of their friends, several of those students
who died, ended their lives in a state of utter disillusionment. The
last three student union leaders up to 1985 had deep seated problems
with the L.T.T.E.. Two of them left the organisation and one died while
doing refugee work. Of the University students who joined the
organisation in the early 1980's, only one remains within. By the latter
part of 1985 the role of the students in the militant movement underwent
a radical change. The students on the whole felt that the militant
groups had gone very much astray and were locked in a war of attrition
with each other. This, they felt had brought the community to a
dangerous brink. The main thrust of student action now was to reform the
militant movement through criticism and persuasion, to provide relief
for refugees, to mediate between the public and the militants and to
foster unity among the militant groups. Usually the students did not go
for confrontation with the militant groups. But they raised specific
questions regarding their conduct. They questioned the killing of Mr.
Anandarajan and called for an explanation. They publicly questioned the
T.E.L.O. over the killing of Rajanikanth. In April 1986 a demonstration
from Vadamaratchi protesting the killing by the T.E.L.O. of T.E.L.O.
members Das and four of his colleagues was fired upon. The students
negotiated with the E.P.R.L.F. and P.L.O.T.E. to protect and shelter the
demonstrators. The bodies of three demonstrators killed were taken to
the University. In doing refugee work the students involved took
considerable risks in going to difficult areas. In 1984 eight students
died while transporting relief supplies to Mullaitivu.

        In this role the students were respected and also feared. Until
the L.T.T.E.-T.E.L.O. clash, the L.T.T.E. found the students movement
useful. Though it no longer provided recruits, its criticisms were
mainly directed against the T.E.L.O.. One reason for this was that the
L.T.T.E.'s actions were more secretive, and could not be directly
ascribed. Following the L.T.T.E.-T.E.L.O. clash the L.T.T.E. moved to
suppress the students. With the Vijitharan affair in November 1986, the
break was complete. Henceforth, the students were scared and silent
spectators. This virtually ended the University's role in the militancy.
Students of the past who had helped the growth of the militancy with
dedication felt that they had been meanly used. The intellectual polish
of the students had been useful. The leadership of the L.T.T.E., which
was dominant by the end of 1986, proved that it had a mind of its own --
a totalitarian mind.

        The July 1983 riots saw many new recruits pour into the militant
movements. The trouble fomented by the government in the Eastern
Province in 1984 found a large number of eastern province youths joining
the militancy. The motivation of these youths was very different from
that of their more intellectual and reflective predecessors from the
University. Revenge, anger and utter helplessness were now leading
motives. But the ground work had already been laid by the articulate
students who had roamed the villages holding meetings. This suited the
militant leadership. The new recruits would do what they were told, and
not ask awkward questions. The L.T.T.E. could now drop its pretences
concerning internationalism and socialism and show itself as a tightly
controlled military organisation. The T.E.L.O. never had any pretences
about intellectual leanings. By September 1985 a large number of
refugees from the Trincomalee district were flooding into Jaffna, and
these refugees who were very desperate were widely used in
demonstrations. Many boys in their early teens from the refugee
population joined mainly the E.P.R.L.F. and the T.E.L.O.. The E.P.R.L.F.
was the first to recruit girls. The L.T.T.E. was however more
discriminating in its recruitment. By December 1986 the L.T.T.E. was the
dominant militant group having alienated and disbanded the other
militant groups. Its military task was now much heavier, and it faced a
severe man power shortage. Under these circumstances the L.T.T.E. was
encouraging recruits even in their early teens. Jaffna's Old Park had
now become a show case for the L.T.T.E., where children watched the
drilling going on after school and would sometimes run away from home to
join. Others might first join their friends who were on sentry duty and
later join fully for the thrill of it. By mid-1987 girls too were being
trained for a military role. Distraught parents became a regular sight
around L.T.T.E. camps crying and begging for their children who had run
away and joined the movement. One would sometimes see comical scenes of
mothers chasing their daughters from an L.T.T.E. camp and dragging them
home, with both daughters and mothers in tears. One lady teacher who
observed some of the teenage L.T.T.E. boys at Old Park coming after a
bath, wondered sadly, how the community can allow such innocent ones,
who hardly knew what they were doing to throw their lives away for an
obscure cause. The wife of a specialist doctor said, that she actually
saw the young boys in the L.T.T.E. camp next door play the children's
game called "hide and seek". The militant movement had come a long way
from its origins amongst the undergraduates of Peradeniya, who talked,
theorised and then went abroad. Death, disillusionment and assassination
had removed most of the able and mature leaders from amongst the
militants. Their average age dropped perhaps from 22 to 14 or 16. The
few leaders who remained enjoyed absolute authority over their
unquestioning ranks.

        The following two conversations give some insight into the minds
of the younger militants.

1.             A T.E.L.O. refugee in London: "I feel bad about seeing
all these posh cars in London. That was one thing I did not lack in
Jaffna. Whenever we saw a new kind of car, we would stop it and drive
around for a bit."

2.             From ex-members of the T.E.A. (Tamil Eelam Army) in Tamil
Nadu: "Our camp was at Vetharaniam. Every afternoon we would drive in a
van at a particular time. We used to have a bit of fun by cutting into
the school girls who were returning home. One day, by accident we
knocked three of them and two died. Anyway, we went to our camp, had
lunch and slept. We were awakened by stones falling on our roof. We went
out, saw an angry crowd and we fired into the air and dispersed the
crowd... When we were in Karainagar and wanted a good meal, we would
drive our truck with the L.M.G. (Light Machine Gun) at the ready at full
speed towards the beach and would fire some volleys into the sea. On our
way back, the villagers would ask what happened. We would reply the the
Sri Lankan navy tried to attack the island and that we repulsed them. We
would then be invited to a meal of mutton curry and pittu [1] ¹ ."

        The T.E.A. was a marginal group under "Panagoda Maheswaran," who
was an engineering student at the University of London. Though an able
military man, his group had no political outlook. Maheswaran's greatest
asset was his improvisation. After leaving Jaffna, he reportedly set up
a workshop in Tamil Nadu to fashion shotguns. When an intrigued person
asked him for an explanation, Maheswaran replied: "I choose the
battlefield according to my equipment." The L.T.T.E. on the other hand
would take the same kind of recruit and motivate him to take the
L.T.T.E.'s cause as a religion for which he would give his life. But the
immaturity, cynicism, and unconcern for civilian life shows through.

        A point to be noted is the manner in which individuals were
affected by the nature of the organisation they joined and the
frustrations it engendered. A medical student, who was known as a
pleasant young man to his friends, later became a notorious torturer
within the T.E.L.O.. After July 1983, almost a whole class of senior
boys at Hartley College, Pt. Pedro, joined the T.E.L.O.. Most of them
were bright students from an elite school with good G.C.E. A. Level
grades (from the government conducted common high school exam in the
island). They made the sacrifice in the belief that within two years
Eelam will be won, enabling them to get back to their careers. An
observer who knew several of them, had this to say: "As time went by
they realised that the struggle would be on for much longer that two
years. They developed a grievance against those of their erstwhile
colleagues who had gone for careers and studies abroad and had
prospered. While having come to realise the shortcomings and limitations
of their organisation, they were too proud to leave it and join another.
They would rather work to bring the T.E.L.O. into prominence as against
other groups, for their personal ambitions and prospects of power now
hinged on the success of the organisation to which they were committed.
Their grievance extended to a contempt for those who pursued ordinary
civilian interests. They regarded themselves as superior to civilians
who were obliged to accept their idea of what was good for them." It
would surprise many who knew the Tamils as an intelligent and highly
educated community, that a combination of moral and intellectual
lethargy, together with a misguided pragmatism, enabled them to build
such high fantasies about the boys. On to their slender and fragile
shoulders were thrust, all the responsibility for the moral and physical
well-being of the community, trusting that barring a few 'small
mistakes', all would be well.

5.4 The rise of the L.T.T.E.

In early 1985, the P.L.O.T.E., L.T.T.E. and T.E.L.O. were considered
fairly evenly balanced. At the time when 7 L.T.T.E. men were killed in a
quarrel with the P.L.O.T.E. at Chullipuram, the L.T.T.E. preferred
discretion to valour. When quarrels developed between the L.T.T.E. and
the T.E.L.O., neither seldom did anything more than go out on motor
bikes and take pot shots at "sentry boys" in the rival group. These
sentry boys, who were youngsters with no military training and in their
early teens, were usually deployed with hand grenades to throw and run
if the alarm had to be raised.

        In reprisal for the killing by the Sri Lankan forces of 70
civilians in Valvettithurai and the damage to the homes of Prabhakaran
and several other L.T.T.E. leaders, the L.T.T.E. on 14 May 1985
conducted what came to be known as the Anuradhapura massacre. A few
L.T.T.E. men drove into Anuradhapura and gunned down about 150 persons
with ruthless efficiency and got away. In the ancient Sinhalese capital,
the government forces were caught off guard. This gave the L.T.T.E. the
reputation of being an efficient "killer machine," that was to be both
feared and respected. The many who approved of the Anuradhapura massacre
little realised that such readiness to play around with lives of
Sinhalese would result in making Tamil lives more insecure.

        However, around January 1986, it was a general belief among
Tamils that no single group could proceed alone against the might of the
Sri Lankan army. Attempts by the Sri Lankan Army in early 1986 on an
L.T.T.E. camp at Suthumalai and a subsequent thrust into Tellipallai,
were repulsed by all the groups acting together, including the T.E.A..
The T.E.L.O. provided critical help in saving the day when troops landed
by helicopter and attacked the L.T.T.E.'s camp at Suthumalai. This was
publicly acknowledged by the L.T.T.E.. It had been rumoured for some
time that the "Das faction" of the T.E.L.O. in Vadamaratchi had some
differences with the leader Sri Sabaratnam. Das was an able military man
-- and this faction was said to form the military backbone of the
T.E.L.O.. The L.T.T.E.'s opportunity came when in April 1986 the Bobby
faction of the T.E.L.O. treacherously shot dead Das and 4 of his
colleagues. They were shot dead while visiting a colleague in the Jaffna
Hospital. This resulted in the Das faction leaving the T.E.L.O. and
going into exile, considerably weakening the T.E.L.O.. Towards the end
of the month the T.E.L.O. moved several of its men outside Jaffna,
ostensibly for operations against the Sri Lankan army. At the same time
the L.T.T.E. moved many of its men into Jaffna and the word was put out
that it was going to attack one of the Sri Lankan encampments. A crucial
advantage possessed by the L.T.T.E. was a modern communications system
with wireless sets. The L.T.T.E. took on the T.E.L.O. at the end of that
month. The pretext was a minor tiff arising from both groups calling a
hartal for the men they had lost at sea, about the same time. After one
week of fighting the L.T.T.E. was supreme in Jaffna. The T.E.L.O. leader
Sri Sabaratnam was killed on 7 May. The methods used by the L.T.T.E.
were reminiscent of the shock tactics used against Sinhalese -- during
the Anuradhapura massacre. In a way the Anuradhapura massacre had come
home and the ghosts of the dead were to haunt us for years to come.

        The manner in which the T.E.L.O. members were killed, shocked
Tamil people everywhere. Many died without knowing what hit them. Twelve
were killed near Manipay while they were asleep. Several were caught
unawares, shot and burnt at junctions at Thirunelvely, Mallakam, and
Tellipallai. Eight persons were killed at the camp behind the St. John's
principal's bungalow. One person was thrust into a car, which was then
exploded, leaving severed limbs strewn around. On hearing this the St.
John's College principal, Mr. Gunaseelan, who was in hospital, had a
relapse which forced him into an early retirement. Many of the T.E.L.O.
members who were from areas outside Jaffna had to flee in fear without
knowing the streets or where they were going. The people were so
terrified, that few found the courage to give shelter to the fugitives.
While this unprecedented display was on, people stood mutely at
junctions and watched, as persons hardly dead, were doused and burnt.
Hardly anyone protested, which is understandable. Some went home saying
things such as: "We have produced our own Hitlers." Others gave a
display of that opportunism that had become a characteristic feature of
Jaffna. Some shop keepers offered aerated waters to those who had
exhausted themselves putting on the show. Some students at the
University attempted to take out a procession to stop the fighting but
had to abandon it. The fighting was over in less than a week and Sri
Sabaratnam was killed in circumstances which are not clear. Most sources
agree that he was wounded in the shoot out, while his two companions
escaped. Sri Sabaratnam then stood up and requested an opportunity to
talk to Kittu, the Jaffna L.T.T.E. leader. He was then gunned down.
Whether he was killed personally by Kittu and whether the order to kill
him came from Prabhakaran himself, or from Kittu, are matters on which
the various reports disagree. All this time the Sri Lankan army had
remained quiet except for a bit of helicopter firing here and there.
Outsiders saw the L.T.T.E.-T.E.L.O. clash as fatally weakening the
militant cause. Kautiliya, a columnist for the Sunday Island asked
satirically whether the L.T.T.E. had taken a sub-contract with the
Ministry for National Security to take on the T.E.L.O..

        Subsequently the L.T.T.E. launched a propaganda campaign where
two reasons were given for its action: 1.The T.E.L.O. were a group of
criminals who had harassed the people and had robbed them. and 2. The
T.E.L.O. was acting as the agent of Indian imperialism.

        To substantiate these accusations, the L.T.T.E. announced that
all recovered stolen items, jewellery, electrical goods and cars were
being returned. In fact several cars taken over and used by the T.E.L.O.
and allegedly stolen television sets and video-recorders were put on
display near Windsor Theatre and were claimed by members of the public.
But little or no jewellery was returned. However the jewellery robbed
from Thurkai Amman Kovil [2] ¹ at Tellipallai mysteriously reappeared
and the wrath of the god was averted. Most people came to terms with
what had happened and thought it was good. The first reason given by the
L.T.T.E. had a strong influence in Jaffna town. The E.P.R.L.F. too
returned several television sets and vehicles saying they were no longer
needed. Several people who wanted the E.P.R.L.F. to keep these things
found themselves left with no choice but to accept them. Amongst the
E.N.L.F. partners only the E.P.R.L.F. found the courage to organise a
protest rally for the killing of Sri Sabaratnam and the betrayal of the
alliance. The E.R.O.S. remained quiet and began to be patted on the back
by the L.T.T.E. as a good organisation, suitable for those who were not
good enough for the L.T.T.E.. The press and the Church too came to terms
with the new dispensation. The Roman Catholic Church under Bishop
Deogupillai, who had been an outspoken critic of Sri Lankan army action
did not use its strong base and its moral authority to protest against
the fatal trend of cowardice and moral torpor within the Tamil
community. The Morning Star, the journal of the Jaffna Diocese of the
Church of South India (C.S.I.) commented editorially in a piece under
the title, The Merry Month of May, that it had been held that the
militant cause had been weakened by what had happened. It went on to
allude that this was not necessarily the case as was proved by the
militants' success in repulsing the subsequent Sri Lankan offensive.
Moreover it said that the people had stood shoulder to shoulder with the
militants during the subsequent bombing of Jaffna. The Jaffna man was a
very wise man who made a virtue of following the path of least
resistance. That the path had to change direction frequently was of no
consequence.

        Claims have been made by the apologists for the action against
the T.E.L.O. that India had ordered the T.E.L.O. to destroy the
L.T.T.E., thus giving the L.T.T.E. no choice. The reason given for such
an order, it is said, is that the L.T.T.E. refused to toe India's line.
Even assuming that India had expressed such a wish, whether the T.E.L.O.
took it seriously is another matter. Granting a certain amount of
cockiness on the T.E.L.O.'s part, it is hard for an observer then in
Jaffna to believe that they had seriously entertained such an ambition
for the near future. They were disorganised and divided as well as
lacking in a communication network. Looking at the circumstances and Sri
Sabaratnam's remarks at Kalviankadu, it does not appear that the
T.E.L.O. was looking for a clash. It has also been mentioned that the
T.E.L.O. had at that time moved a large number of trained men out of
Jaffna while the L.T.T.E. did the opposite amidst rumours that they were
to take on a Sri Lankan army encampment.

        A significant circumstance was a serious division within the
T.E.L.O. made worse a month earlier by killing by the Bobby faction of 5
leading members of the Das faction. A similar circumstance minus the
assassinations was to precede the L.T.T.E.'s taking on the E.P.R.L.F., 7
months later - namely, the split arising from differences between
Padmanabha, the E.P.R.L.F.'s political leader and Douglas Devananda, the
leader of its military wing.

        A short time after the L.T.T.E.-T.E.L.O. incident, an E.P.R.L.F.
leader told a leading citizen that his leadership had asked the L.T.T.E.
leadership what they really wanted and to state the terms on which they
could work together. He further added that no reply had been
forthcoming.

        On the question of India, most Tamils had unreal expectations of
altruism on India's part, while they revelled in thinking how smart they
were in using India to get Eelam. They knew the nature of Indian
politics and thought they could manipulate it for their ends. The two
aspects of altruism and baseness that governed the Tamil man's
perception of India corresponded to the sentimental and the real.
Equally, talk of any militant group being independent of India was
meaningless after the initial surrender in exchange for arms, training,
base facilities and recognition. This would be sharpened later after
September 1987 by the L.T.T.E.'s successive contradictory positions
involving considerable amnesia. The real sufferers would be the Tamil
people. The thought that India could have interests, legitimate as big
power politics goes, weighed little on people's minds.

        Following the L.T.T.E.-T.E.L.O. clash, the L.T.T.E. understood
the feelings of ordinary people. Loudspeaker vehicles went about telling
people not to talk about or analyse what had happened. This was the
first publicly announced act of censorship. Previously the L.T.T.E. and
the T.E.L.O. especially had visited newspapers to tell them not to write
about certain incidents.

        About 20 May, 1986, the Sri Lankan government launched a limited
offensive to test the strength of the militant movement after the
excision of the T.E.L.O.. The column that advanced from Elephant Pass
turned back at Pallai. One group broke out of the Jaffna Fort and
established a beach-head at Mandaitivu, providing a safe means of
supplying troops at Jaffna Fort, for, helicopters landing inside the
fort were subject to fire from nearby. The Sri Lankan army also
succeeded in widening the perimeters of its camps at Thondamanaru and
Valvettithurai. Until May the question amongst civilians was, when would
the militants make an attempt on one of the army camps. The question now
was when would the Sri Lankan army make an all out attempt to recapture
Jaffna. It was well understood that the L.T.T.E. would make a formidable
foe.

        An aspect of L.T.T.E. dominance that made it acceptable to the
general public was that robberies virtually ceased. The poor and the
middle classes were left alone. The L.T.T.E. made mutually beneficial
arrangements with wholesale merchants and big businessmen to the
satisfaction of the latter. They could now enjoy their profits without
the nuisance of being occasionally kidnapped for ransom. Before May
1986, if a man allegedly committed a fraud, the first militant group to
discover it would descend on him, most likely in the night, to carry out
an investigation. Occasionally, the victim would be lamp-posted (shot
after being tied to an lamp post), or would be let off after negotiating
an appropriate fee. After May 1986, several goods, aerated waters and
cigarettes went up in price. In the best of times petrol sold at Rs. 19
per litre as against Rs. 13.50 per litre south of Vavuniya. Huge profits
were made by dealers. Transport bottlenecks in a way proved a blessing
to many peasants and labourers who were thrown out of work by the war.
Many turned to transporting petrol to Jaffna on a small scale by
bicycles and selling it by the bottle on the roadside. In this at least,
the Sinhalese and Tamils on the border of the Northern province
co-operated for their mutual prosperity. Another example of how the
Jaffna economy worked was given by a head teacher from Chavakachcheri.
Soon after the commencement of Operation Liberation on 26 May 1987,
refugees from Vadamaratchi flooded into Thenmaratchi and the demand for
rice was great. The normal price of a bag was Rs. 230/. A mill owner who
had a very large quantity of rice paid Rs. 50,000 tax money and sold his
stock at the rate of Rs. 400 per bag, making an astronomical profit.

        It was now expected that the L.T.T.E. would soon make a bid for
sole dominance. Only the E.P.R.L.F. (Eelam Peoples' Revolutionary
Liberation Front) seemed to be in a mood to challenge the L.T.T.E.. The
E.R.O.S. (Eelam Revolutionary Organisation of Students) and the T.E.A.
accepted L.T.T.E.'s dominance. The E.R.O.S. was a much smaller group
which one time acquired for itself in the popular mind a reputation for
intelligence and discipline. But its allegiance to Marxism was more
doubtful, together with its concern for Sinhalese civilians. The talk of
some of its leadership and its ranks gave the impression that it
appealed to gut feelings of narrow nationalism. Its killing of Mr.
Kathiramalai, a Sarvodaya worker, left strong doubts about its
commitment to fairplay.

        The middle of 1986 saw a series of sensational bombings carried
out in the South. The main incidents were the explosion which destroyed
an Airlanka Tristar passenger airliner which was being loaded for
take-off at the Katunayake airport; the explosion in the C.T.O. (Central
Telecommunications Office) building in the heart of Colombo Fort; the
explosion at the Elephant House aerated water factory; and the explosion
at the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (C.P.C.) depot at Anuradhapura. The
civilian dead numbered several tens. Like the Anuradhapura massacre it
was an adoption by the oppressed of the methods of the oppressor, and
hence also the disease of the oppressor. The explosion at the C.P.C.
depot at Anuradhapura also represented a move away from impersonal
terror. An explosive charge was placed inside a petrol bowser from the
Puloly Multipurpose Cooperative Stores (M.P.C.S.) that had gone to
collect fuel from Anuradhapura. Several bowsers from Jaffna were in the
petrol queue. It was reported that two persons who went in the bowser
were amongst those killed. It was widely claimed in the international
media that the parties responsible for these bombings were connected
with the L.T.T.E., or the E.R.O.S. or both. The T.E.A. was also
mentioned because of its association with the bomb meant for the
Airlanka flight, which exploded instead at the Madras, Meenambakam
airport in 1984.

        No group claimed responsibility for these attacks. But according
to Tamil sources living abroad, responsibility was claimed privately by
senior persons in a militant group that ostensibly valued above all,
intelligence, research and scholarship. There were also explosions in
public transport buses carrying mainly Sinhalese passengers near
Vavuniya. Two of the victims were an elderly Sinhalese gentleman and his
son, who had been unswerving in their hospitality towards Tamil public
transport workers.

        Besides blurring in the minds abroad of the distinction between
terror by the Sri Lankan state and that by Tamil militant groups,
another consequence of this incident was to make petroleum fuels,
aerated waters and gas more expensive and scarce in Jaffna.

        It has been said by many that such acts against the Sinhalese
population made the Sinhalese think seriously about the Tamil problem.
It did make them think, but only in a perverse sort of way. One could
see, for instance in editorials, the pressure mounting for peace talks
when terror is seen as being too close for comfort. Equally, there was
pressure for a final military thrust, during transient spells of seeming
military successes, such as during Operation Liberation. This made the
whole affair a destructive game involving extensive media manipulation
in the absence of any change of heart and any democratic resurgence.

        For the time being, life in Jaffna was relatively peaceful,
barring occasional shelling by the Sri Lankan army. The L.T.T.E.
concentrated on bringing all key institutions under its control. The
Citizens' Committees caused no problems. Except at the University, this
operation needed neither force nor intimidation. The L.T.T.E. was subtle
and discerning in this matter. In the hospitals and in the
administration, doctors and officials were left with enough discretion
to protect their self respect. Dissent from individuals was tolerated
provided this was not articulated through mass movements or other
militant groups. An attempt at an L.T.T.E. sponsored Journalists' Union
through some journalists who had come over to its side foundered,
because the majority of the journalists found it too hard to swallow.
The pretext given by the L.T.T.E. for summoning a meeting of journalists
was that it was concerned that journalists in Jaffna were not being paid
the salaries stipulated by the government in a gazette notification. The
editor of the Uthayan, together with others, spoke to the effect: "The
question of salaries is a matter for the journalists themselves, and not
for a militant organisation. No one is going to control what we think or
write." These brave words however, were not reflected in practice.
Everyone knew that he would be a brave man to go beyond certain limits.
The Eelanadu management dismissed a journalist, whose presence it
apparently thought was embarrassing under the new dispensation. (This
journalist, Mr. Shanmugalingam, has not been seen after being abducted
by the L.T.T.E. on 6 November, 1989.) The L.T.T.E. went ahead with
organising rural courts, vigilante committees and bodies such as
cultural and development committees. The L.T.T.E. was privately cynical
and disrespectful of persons who served on these bodies. A top L.T.T.E.
leader once asked an old friend and senior journalist: "Those who were
with us in the days when the going was dangerous and we were hounded by
the Sri Lankan forces now refuse to touch us with a broomstick. But
those who are joining us in large numbers now are persons whom we would
have once classed as anti-social elements. Why is this?" The friend
replied: "You should have no difficulty in finding out yourself."

        The population of Jaffna fell in line. People who had once shown
the spirit to resist the oppression of the Sri Lankan state now enjoyed
the peace of the animals in George Orwell's Animal Farm. People would
now get about unconcerned if a neighbour mysteriously taken away then
disappeared. Some who were not prepared to do this were students of the
University of Jaffna. In the circumstances they acted bravely during the
Vijitharan and Rajaharan affairs. It is a comforting thought that the
idealism of youth cannot be quelled.

        The two incidents took place in quick succession around early
November 1986 and gave rise to what became the last mass protest in
Jaffna against the violation of basic freedoms. It did not, like the
mass protests against the Prevention of Terrorism Act in the early
1980's, exude a sense of buoyancy and forward movement. This was more a
rearguard action. When it ended, many of its leaders had to go into
hiding or seek exile. Many of the leaders and hundreds of ordinary women
from the lower reaches of society had displayed rare courage in doing
something that was both essential and at the same time was shirked by
their so called betters. The two incidents concerned had independent
origins.

        Arunagirinathan Vijitharan was a third year commerce student
from the University of Jaffna who was generally unknown until he was
missing from his boarding house on 4 November 1986. The question was,
why Vijitharan? He was by all accounts an ordinary fun loving student
with no political affiliations. It was this aspect of it that left some
doubts about the cause. Had he said something mildly offensive to a
person of some importance as students are wont to do? One may never
know.

        An action committee was formed by the students. They did not
accuse anyone. They simply maintained that the four functioning militant
groups were responsible for the security of persons in Jaffna. Further,
they had sentries everywhere, making it unlikely that persons could
disappear without their knowledge. The militant groups were called upon
to do their acknowledged duty and restore Vijitharan. Privately, the
students admitted that they were afraid and were in no mood to confront
any militant group. A senior University official who was talking to the
militant groups on the matter, expressed the feeling that the students
had acted too hastily in making the matter public. On the other hand,
the students felt that if they kept quiet, the chances of students
disappearing one by one was greater. Not having received a satisfying
response, the students commenced a campaign of fasting on 19 November in
which six persons, both boys and girls began a fast in a temporary
cadjan shed in front of the administration block.

        For the next ten days the University became the centre of
attraction for all those who had been suppressing their feelings about
what was going on. An important group of people who joined the students
were residents, especially women, from Passaiyoor. That had to do with a
separate incident, concerning the death of Edward.

        Passaiyoor is a fishing village three miles East along the coast
from Jaffna town. These people were Roman Catholics and were by nature
spontaneous in their collective response to perceived aggression against
them. Edward had returned from Saudi Arabia and the family was said to
be sympathetic towards the L.T.T.E.. They had consulted the parish
priest on the matter of a land dispute with a neighbour, and not being
satisfied, had invited Malaravan, the Ariyalai leader of the L.T.T.E..
During the hearing, Edward's mother reportedly said something offensive
to Malaravan, who in turn is said to have raised his hand against her.
Edward then slapped Malaravan. Edward was later asked to call at the
Ariyalai camp for an inquiry. Fearing what may happen, Edward contacted
the parish priest. The latter went to the camp and got an assurance that
Edward would be released after a short inquiry and that no harm would
befall him. The parish priest accompanied Edward to the camp and waited.
Edward was taken in. Twenty minutes later the priest was told that
Edward was dead. The priest fainted and was admitted to hospital. Those
who went to see the body said that hardly a bone was left unbroken. Then
things took a turn that was unusual for Jaffna. A large group of women
gathered at the local church and protested for several days, displaying
hand written posters. The middle-class based women's organisations,
including the Mothers' Front, had lost their voice in the face of
internal oppression.

        The university students went out and addressed students from the
higher forms in schools, who in turn came out and joined by sitting on
roads and joining processions. An element of irony was added to the
proceedings when the L.T.T.E. leader V. Prabhakaran commenced a Gandhi
style fast in Madras when the Indian police confiscated his arms and
communications equipment. A non-violent protest was on for the return of
instruments of violence. Rival processions for the student cause and
Prabhakaran's cause sometimes crossed each other.

        At this point many diverse opinions came to be expressed, most
of them agreeing that the students should give up their fast. Some felt
that the students were excellently performing a very necessary task; but
the community did not deserve the deaths of those who were fasting. If
they died, six prospective leaders would be lost while people would
shrug their shoulders and go on as before. Then little would be
achieved. Many were hostile. They thought that the Tamils were being
divided in the face of the main enemy, the Sri Lankan state, when they
should be uniting behind the L.T.T.E.. Students were made heart broken
and angry by an opinion expressed by a member of the staff who said that
the students were making an absurd issue over one missing person when
several L.T.T.E. men were dying fighting the Sri Lankan army. They were
dismayed that such persons could not see the issues at stake and that
one could in time come to mean hundreds. Besides, passive acquiescence
by the community in such developments during a fight for freedom, would
lead to its opposite, thus negating all sacrifice, including the
militants' sacrifice.

        The Jaffna press played it diplomatically by giving equal
prominence to statements by all parties. The E.P.R.L.F. backed the
students. The E.R.O.S. characteristically sat on the fence. The students
were painfully aware that their protest could become interpreted as
anti-L.T.T.E. and backed by rival militant groups who did not wish to
confront the L.T.T.E. directly. A speech delivered by an E.P.R.L.F.
leader at the university, the contents of which did not receive prior
approval from the students, gave further room for this impression.

        Two of the student leaders were former members of the P.L.O.T.E.
and the E.P.R.L.F.. However, available information strongly suggests
that they were not principally anti-L.T.T.E., but had rather become
disillusioned with the anti-democratic militarism of all the groups, now
enjoying Indian patronage. There was strong pressure on the students to
give up the protest, and the L.T.T.E. too was embarrassed by it. But the
problem was how to end it. A mutually acceptable formula had to be
found. Even admirers of the protest felt that it had gone on long enough
and that no further purpose would be served by its prolongation. A
number of persons and organisations came to patch up a settlement,
including the University Teachers' Association (U.T.A.). Some wanted to
do some good. Others had reasons which were more complex.

        The L.T.T.E.'s conduct was puzzling. They could have in the
first instance said that they sympathised with the students and would
make every effort to trace Vijitharan. Then there would have been no
protest. But they took an aggressive line. School children who joined
the protests were threatened by leading L.T.T.E. men at both Mahajana
College, Tellipallai, and near Jaffna Hindu College. In the latter
instance a student's name was singled out. The U.T.A. invited Kittu for
a meeting in the Senior Common Room, where he was introduced as "our
General." The session was marked by the silence of the staff, making one
wonder why the meeting was called. Kittu took the line that if a
militant group had abducted Vijitharan, they are not going to admit it
amidst all this protest. He may be released, he said, far away at some
distant time. He also made the point that traitors like Selvabala cannot
be given amnesty on the grounds that they were students or on any other
pretext. He was referring to a student from the Jaffna College Technical
Institute who was said by the L.T.T.E. to have been armed and paid by
the Sri Lankan army to assassinate Kittu and other key L.T.T.E. leaders.
Selvabala was killed after he made a Singapore style T.V. confession on
the L.T.T.E.'s station Niedharshanam.

        Eventually a formula for ending the fast was reached. The
L.T.T.E. gave a pledge to look for Vijitharan. Like many of the tales of
intrigue, the truth about Vijitharan may not surface for years to come.
For the University students, it ended for the time being their role in
public affairs. With all their weaknesses and drawbacks, their role had
been a noble one. They had been forced into tasks where others more
mature and experienced than they ought to have given the lead. For the
Tamil people, another light had gone out. Vimaleswaran, the student
leader who led the protest fast, paid a heavy price for his defiance of
the new order. He was assassinated in July, 1988.

        The natural defiance of the women from the lower classes
remained a remarkable feature as opposed to the pliability of upper
class women. Village women in the East went out with rice pounders to
stop the internecine fighting during the L.T.T.E.-T.E.L.O. clash. When
the L.T.T.E. took on the E.P.R.L.F. on 14 December 1986, women from some
low class villages in Jaffna near Keerimalai and Mallakam defied the
L.T.T.E. by sitting on the roads armed with kitchen knives and chillie
powder. The same women were to prove a nightmare to the Indians when
they arrived. After October 1987 some of these women in the Pt. Pedro
fish market decided that they would charge the Indians higher prices.
This was noticed by a customer who took his turn after an Indian
soldier. When asked, the fisher lady replied, "They came here to eat,
did they?"

        One newspaper editor who came out well during the affair was Mr.
S. M. Gopalaratnam of the Eelamurasu. He had once served as editor of
the Eelandu and was made editor of the Eelamurasu a short while before
the protest. During the crisis he wrote several bold editorials and
articles. The need for unity amongst Tamils was something he felt
strongly about. When the L.T.T.E. took on the E.P.R.L.F. he wrote an
editorial expressing his concern for the hundreds of youths who had died
in disillusionment with a feeling of being abandoned. He said that the
Tamils' failure to unite had left them exposed before their enemies.
Barely two months after he took over, the paper passed under L.T.T.E.
management. However the L.T.T.E. treated him with respect and quite
often he had his way. An unsolicited tribute was paid to S.M.G., as he
was fondly called, by the management of the University Senior Common
Room: During the time S.M.G. wrote his independent editorials the
Eelamurasu was the only paper to by kept out of the Common Room. With
the new L.T.T.E. management of the paper from 1 January 1987, the paper
reappeared in the Common Room after a month. As regards S.M.G., the
L.T.T.E. may have shown higher standards than that citadel of
intellectual freedom. The L.T.T.E. often respected those who dealt with
them honestly.

5.5 Differences among the Militants

The public had up to now thought of the L.T.T.E. as a monolith. But in
the second half of 1986 differences, rivalries and personal ambitions
within the L.T.T.E. which had a politics of its own began to surface and
were talked about. Sources with good connections talked of differences
between the Jaffna leader, Kittu and the then Vavuniya leader Mahattaya.
The latter is said to have felt that those in Jaffna were being spoilt
by glamour and a relatively easy life. Following the events of May 1986
several senior L.T.T.E. men left the group. One of them was Kandeepan
who was in charge of the Islands. After leaving the organisation he
simply stayed in his home at Ariyalai without wanting to see any of his
former colleagues. The L.T.T.E. apparently wished to talk to him in
order to persuade him to rejoin. Kandeepan was a competent military man
who had pioneered the use of sea-mines. The lower ranks had been
reportedly disoriented by the departure of several senior men. After
refusing to see Kittu on two occasions the third time he was surrounded
in order to force a meeting. But Kandeepan ran into his house and
swallowed cyanide. The L.T.T.E. delayed the confirmation of his death
and forced the family to perform the last rites in the early hours of
the morning. Before his death Kandeepan had complained to one of his old
friends that during the clash with the T.E.L.O., his organisation had
promptly sent reinforcements to the Islands. But when the Sri Lankan
government made an attempt on Mandaitivu, Kandeepan had submitted a plan
which only required a modest quantity of arms. The organisation had not,
he had complained, responded to this request. Mandaitivu was lost and
Kandeepan was heart broken.

        The Mannar leader Victor was killed in Adampan during a skirmish
with the Sri Lankan army during October 1986. Thirteen Sri Lankan army
personnel were killed during this skirmish and two were captured.
Victor's body was brought to Jaffna with the two prisoners and nine Sri
Lankan corpses. In the first exhibition of this kind, the two prisoners
and the corpses were exhibited at Nallur Kanthasamy Kovil, while
thousands filed past. Victor's body was taken in state to several parts
of Jaffna to be viewed by milling crowds. Kittu considerably boosted his
image by speaking at these meetings. His statement that Victor like all
the L.T.T.E. leaders was in the battle front with his men, was reported
in the press and seen as a direct challenge to Prabhakaran. Prabhakaran
had been in Madras for the previous few years. The feeling was also
around that Prabhakaran would make an attempt to cut Kittu down to size.
It is believed the Prabhakaran's coming in January 1987 to Jaffna had
something to do with Kittu's ambitions.

        On 14 December, 1986, the E.P.R.L.F., the P.L.O.T.E. and the
T.E.A. were disbanded by the L.T.T.E.. In the Northern Province the
E.P.R.L.F. fled its camps without a fight. Several E.P.R.L.F. leaders
were arrested and many of them were tortured in order to make them
disclose locations of hidden arms. At this point one may point to what
seems a qualitative difference in outlook between the L.T.T.E. and other
groups. The L.T.T.E. men were trained to carry out orders from the top
blindly. There is no doubt that the other groups have displayed the same
kind of courage in confronting the Sri Lankan army. But when it came to
an open confrontation with a fellow militant group, the other groups
seem to have been handicapped by a certain amount of reluctance and
confusion. There was a certain amount of inhibition about killing fellow
Tamils. An observer living close to the E.P.R.L.F. camp at Uduvil said
that there was a split amongst the ranks as to whether they should go in
for a bloody fratricidal confrontation with the L.T.T.E. or simply go
into hiding. Before this could be resolved, the L.T.T.E. came and caught
them unprepared. This left them with no option but to disperse. Like the
split in the T.E.L.O. which the L.T.T.E. took advantage of, this time a
split in the E.P.R.L.F. between Douglas Devananda, the leader of its
military wing, and the leadership under Padmanabha was a chance the
L.T.T.E. had been waiting for. In the middle of this confusion the
E.P.R.L.F. had challenged the L.T.T.E. politically over the Vijitharan
affair. While the E.P.R.L.F. had expected a military response from the
L.T.T.E., it was undecided as to what it should do.

        The P.L.O.T.E. in Jaffna had a strong base amongst the high
caste, middle-class Tamils in Valigamam North and Central. They also had
a political programme which emphasised work amongst the masses. These
combined to give it an image in certain quarters as a disciplined
organisation in dealings with the people. However P.L.O.T.E. members
have been used by the high castes, on several occasions in disputes with
the lower castes. P.L.O.T.E. had suffered discredit as a result of
internal killings in Tamil Nadu and from at least two gruesome incidents
in Jaffna. Five of its own women cadres were killed by members of the
P.L.O.T.E. at Maniamthoddam, Jaffna, in 1985. Also in early 1985, seven
L.T.T.E. sympathisers who were putting up posters in Chullipuram, were
badly tortured and killed by P.L.O.T.E. men under Kandasamy (Chankili).
By mid-1986 the organisation had suffered from neglect from the
leadership in India and was poorly armed. With the dissolution of the
T.E.L.O. there was a very real threat that the Sri Lankan army may
overrun Jaffna at any time. Here the P.L.O.T.E. cadre in Jaffna earned
the respect of the population for the sentry work it did around army
encampments. It used its training to advance towards Jaffna Fort, along
K.K.S. Road behind a barrier of advancing sand bags. Its men crawled
through drains and other cover to install land mines fairly close to
Jaffna Fort. When hints were given that the P.L.O.T.E. was to be
disbanded the P.L.O.T.E. sentries withdrew from Jaffna town exploding
their land mines. Thereupon, the Sri Lankan forces fired back thinking
that they were being attacked and a senior prefect at Central College
was killed. The disbandment of the P.L.O.T.E. and the E.P.R.L.F. created
a crisis in the manning of sentry points, making it even more likely
that the Sri Lankan army would attempt to break out if the current
negotiations failed.

        By this time the L.T.T.E. in Jaffna, under Kittu, had
established friendly personal relations with Captain Kotelawela of the
Sri Lankan army and leading personalities amongst the Sinhalese, such as
Vijaya Kumaranatunga, Vincent Perera and the Rev. Fr. Yohan Devananda.
Kittu and his deputy Raheem became celebrated personalities in the
South. The L.T.T.E. and the government gave the impression that a move
for a negotiated settlement was on. A set of proposals, called the
December 19th proposals, which had been drafted with India's help were
announced by the Sri Lankan government on the 26th of December for
discussion. The L.T.T.E. announced that it was taking over the civil
administration of Jaffna from 1 January 1987, although in practice this
could have made little difference. The government in turn announced a
fuel and firewood blockade on Jaffna. Prabhakaran moved to Jaffna in
early January 1987 after several years in India. The crisis had entered
a new phase.

5.6 The Eastern Question

By 1985 youths from districts in the Northern Province outside Jaffna
and from the Eastern Province which had been ravaged by Sri Lankan
military action which included massacres, were playing a numerically
dominant role in the militant groups. Unlike the articulate youth of
Jaffna who had joined in the early 1980's because of ideals of national
liberation and a feeling of collective humiliation, these rural youths
had been subject to some harrowing experiences at first hand. By the end
of 1985, those of the Tamil residents of Trincomalee district outside
the city who were alive, had become refugees. The L.T.T.E. leader
Pulendran, who came to be feared by Sinhalese, is said to have seen most
of his family killed by Sri Lankan forces before his eyes. In such a
situation the killing and counter-killing of Tamil and Sinhalese
civilians became the order of the day. Yet the leadership of the
militant movement was mainly Jaffna-dominated. After mid-1985, Jaffna
enjoyed relative peace whilst the other Tamil areas continued to be at
the receiving end. The majority amongst the T.E.L.O. youths killed in
May 1986 were from the rural areas. The E.P.R.L.F. continued to be
active in the Batticaloa district after it was wound down in Jaffna in
December 1986.

        One factor which distinguished the militant movement in the East
was that ideological and group differences were over-ridden by a feeling
that they were all Eastern Province Tamils united through the experience
of common suffering, who must stand together or perish. Group
differences mattered far less than in Jaffna. Often they shared camps
and meals. When the L.T.T.E. was given orders by radio to go for the
T.E.L.O. in May 1986, the killings in the East were far fewer than in
Jaffna. At Sambur, according to a T.E.L.O. source in Trincomalee,
T.E.L.O. members who were having a meal were called out by members of
the L.T.T.E. who had been erstwhile friends. The T.E.L.O. men were
unaware of such orders having been given and went out as if to meet
friends, when their leader and two others were killed. At Sambaltivu,
according to a Trincomalee resident, women went out with rice pounders
to ensure that there was no killing. This was in contrast to suburban
Jaffna where people watched mutely during the killings. However, during
December 1986 when the L.T.T.E. went after the E.P.R.L.F., some
villagers in rural Jaffna protected the E.P.R.L.F. cadre by blocking the
roads, armed with knives and chillie powder.

        When the L.T.T.E.-T.E.L.O. clash started in Jaffna, Kadavul, the
Batticaloa leader of the L.T.T.E. and former agriculture student,
promptly summoned a meeting of leaders of all militant groups in
Batticaloa. They issued a joint statement that the problems of the East
were different and should be handled differently. Kadavul, a native of
the East, gave a personal assurance that all militants in Batticaloa
would be protected. The L.T.T.E. command in Jaffna then radioed two of
its commanders Kumarappa and Pottu, both of Jaffna origin, who were in
Batticaloa, to carry out the assault on the T.E.L.O.. Several T.E.L.O.
members were killed. Kadavul left the L.T.T.E. and went abroad.

        An academic from the Batticaloa University and a close follower
of events also told us that the L.T.T.E. taking on the E.P.R.L.F. in
December 1986 worked very much to the detriment of the Tamils in the
East. The E.P.R.L.F. had begun to prove itself effective against the
dreaded S.T.F. (Special Task Force). It had just carried out a series of
successful landmine attacks against the S.T.F., thus restricting its
movement. The L.T.T.E.'s protracted battle with the E.P.R.L.F. opened
the field to the S.T.F.. The S.T.F. started the new year in 1987 with
the Kokkadichcholai massacre in which scores of Tamil civilians were
murdered. The L.T.T.E. was forced to withdraw from one of its
strongholds.

        A consequence of these developments and the desperate plight of
Tamils of the East, was that leaders of the Eastern Tamils were
generally amenable to a settlement on the basis of the December 19th
proposals which envisaged separate provincial councils for the Northern
and Eastern Provinces. The powers devolved in policing and land
settlement were generally deemed inadequate, but were the subject of
negotiation. In Jaffna which was relatively secure, a more hawkish mood
prevailed, backed by L.T.T.E. propaganda, an enfeebled press and a
section of the articulate intelligentsia. Those in Jaffna who felt that
the Tamils, now dangerously weakened, must in the common interest use
India's good offices to negotiate the best possible settlement,
sometimes found through experience that they should not express
themselves too loudly. Inevitably there arose a widespread feeling
amongst Eastern Tamils, that the Jaffna based Tamil leadership had
failed them. The Eastern Province Tamils will in the years to come have
to resolve the question of their dealings with Northern Tamils and their
relations with Muslims and Sinhalese in the East, whom they have for
neighbours. The question is proving a thorny one today. [Top]
