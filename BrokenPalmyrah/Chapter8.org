JUNE - JULY: INDIA ENTERS

8.1 The Airdrop and the L.T.T.E.'s Dilemma

With the Indian airdrop of relief supplies on 4 June, the Sri Lankan
army was forced to call off its offensive in Jaffna after scenting
victory. The L.T.T.E. had been administered an unpleasant shock and was
reeling. India had demonstrated to the Tamils that it was ultimately
India on whom the Tamils must depend. India now wanted a presence in
Jaffna and there was much talk between Colombo and Delhi. It was agreed
that Indian relief supplies would be distributed to the people of
Jaffna, jointly by a team of Indian and Ceylonese Red Cross personnel.
India underlined the allegedly humanitarian nature of its mission.
During Operation Liberation and earlier All India Radio had given
publicity to the L.T.T.E.'s version of civilian casualties. The figure
went up to 2000 dead, while later estimates of the figure were between
400 and 700. India had also alleged carpet bombing of Vadamaratchi. The
Sri Lankan government tried to make much of this. When foreign
journalists were flown later in by the government, they could see few
signs of carpet bombing. All this was to irk the Tamil people later when
All India Radio would switch from the exaggerations of May (with which
the Tamils were happy) to obvious untruths in the wake of India's own
offensive in Jaffna later in October. One consequence of India's vocal
criticism of the Sri Lankan government's use of air power, was that
India was slow to admit its use of air power during its offensive in
October.

        During 1987, the Sri Lankan use of air power had a deliberate
vindictive purpose. Civilians were expected to get killed. Its main
effect was to keep the L.T.T.E. shifting houses. Still most of the time,
as FM conversations between airmen showed, its use was usually
restrained. The nature of the target was generally verified before
action was taken. By restraint, one means that those lucky enough not to
live within 100 yards of an L.T.T.E. camp could consider themselves
reasonably safe during air raids. This did not apply to shelling. The
element of discrimination was even more vitiated when fertile minds in
the national security ministry introduced the Avro-dropped barrel bomb.

        The L.T.T.E. was now facing a crisis of prestige, as India was
set to become top dog. After casting about for an issue on which to
build up support, it picked on G.C.E. A. Level examinations. Its student
wing, the S.A.L.T. wanted a boycott of A.Level examinations in July for
the reason that Vadamaratchi was in a bad way, with its education
disrupted, so that it was considered wrong for other Tamils to do their
examinations unless a postponement was granted. The S.A.L.T. leaders
went about schools canvassing the boycott. The response from boys'
schools was of a noticeably low order in comparison with that from
girls' schools. Young men with a military bearing led by Major Murali of
the L.T.T.E. canvassing in schools brought about a flutter of response
in the girls' schools. Middle class girls were quite prominent in the
boycott movement.

        But the boycott move was unpopular with the parents and a silent
majority of the affected students. Many influential persons with
children who were A.Level candidates busily ran around canvassing
opinion and getting through to key L.T.T.E. leaders. Pressure was
brought about even from within the ranks of prominent L.T.T.E.
supporters. The L.T.T.E. thought it wise to backtrack.

        The boycott was ceremonially called off. The L.T.T.E. was
praised for its show of wisdom. Tamils from devastated areas outside
Jaffna wondered why there was no call to boycott when they had been
affected. Many girls had become enamoured of the L.T.T.E.. This remained
true. The role of girls in the L.T.T.E. had by now become significant.
Several were to die in action against the I.P.K.F. in October, including
at least one girl from Chundikuli Girls' College.

        One often finds amongst intelligent middle class girls from
English speaking homes, a reckless emotional drive to serve a cause like
that of the L.T.T.E.'s. Being very articulate speakers, they bring in
many village girls who are anxious to imitate them. But the middle class
girls soon get frustrated by fascist tendencies in the organisation.
Many of them develop problems of conscience and are unable to conform
their independence and initiative to the tastes of the organisation.
Once the honeymoon is over, many of these girls wish to leave. The
parents quickly get into the act and pack off the girl to stay with an
aunt in Colombo so as to get over the trauma. An S.O.S. would then be
sent to a relative abroad to get her out. The girl would then continue
with her studies abroad and get over the past. But for the village girls
who get into the organisation under the influence of their middle class
peers, things work out tragically. They too may want to leave the
organisation for very much the same reasons. But they have nowhere to
go. Their parents may not have the means to help them. For them it
requires a great deal of courage.

        On 25 June, the Indian ship Srivastava, bringing relief supplies
docked at K.K.S.. Crowds lined the route taken by the Indian embassy
officials Mr. Puri and Captain Gupta together with the Indian Red Cross
team, on their way to Jaffna. This resembled something of a triumphal
march. The L.T.T.E.'s position was a difficult one as the Indians aimed
directly for the people's affections. It tried to give the event a
different colour, by trying to behave as though it was the power in
charge and was welcoming Indian efforts as helping the L.T.T.E. to
achieve its aims. It urged the crowd to shout amongst other slogans, a
request for arms. But the real feelings of the crowd came out as people
again and again broke down in front of the Indian officials, saying
simply, "India save us."

        On 5 July, the L.T.T.E. launched a suicide attack against the
Sri-Lankan army camp at Nelliady Central College. The Sri Lankan army
had reduced its strength in Vadamaratchi from 8000 to 3000 men. No one
was expecting a major outbreak of violence. The government had agreed to
a ceasefire to facilitate the distribution of Indian relief supplies.
The L.T.T.E. was also understood to be a party to this. But as in the
past both sides could find excuses for not honouring ceasefires. The Sri
Lankan S.T.F. action in Batticaloa was as good as any. Earlier that day,
armed L.T.T.E. men were spotted at Nelliady and something had been
expected. The entrance to Nelliady Central College was located in a
narrow road connecting Nelliady town with Vathiri junction. Civilians
were living just opposite the school and the army encouraged the use of
the road as a public relations exercise. Miller, a member of the
L.T.T.E.'s new black Tigers drove a van packed with explosives through
the school gates into the front building. The government claimed that 20
of its soldiers died. Publicising its action through notice boards as a
"great achievement," the L.T.T.E. claimed 100 soldiers killed. Other
sources said that the government figure was much nearer the truth. The
army had been expecting something of this nature, and what took place
was not a major setback. Troops took up positions and the Nelliady camp
held out. What was surprising was the manner in which the army reacted.
The government had been keen to revive confidence in the people and make
Vadamaratchi a success. An elaborate public relations exercise was going
on. All this was shattered as the army let loose with a barrage of
cannon fire. Perhaps up to 20 civilians died in the shelling. Several
others were shot as they fled. In one incident at Navindil, a group of
12 elderly persons were moving towards Udupiddy. When a round of
shelling commenced they took shelter in the porch of a house, which the
owners had apparently fled. A group of soldiers who arrived peeped
through the window and observed that cooking had been going on for a
large party. The 12 persons were accused of feeding the L.T.T.E..
Despite their denials, they were shot and pushed into the trench by
soldiers of the 4th Division of the Gajaba Regiment Only the wife of a
Singer company agent escaped by feigning death. In another incident a
shell falling on the Karaveddy Roman Catholic Church killed 5 refugees.
People were not taking chances this time. An estimated 90% of the
population fled Southwards as refugees. A few remained close to the
towns of Pt. Pedro, Udupiddy and Valvettithurai. Vadamaratchi was
described as a place for goats and stray dogs. The lack of clear policy
and army discipline demonstrated to India's advantage the Sri Lankan
government's limitations in making headway with solving the problem.

        With many people, the L.T.T.E. had redeemed its reputation after
running away in the face of Operation Liberation. This again pointed to
the fickleness of public opinion in Jaffna. In the rest of Jaffna things
went on as if nothing had happened. Refugee woes in newspapers were part
of the fare. To the L.T.T.E. it was a desultory achievement which once
again underlined its dependence on civilian cover. Once the civilians
fled, the L.T.T.E. found it difficult to stay on in Vadamaratchi. The
L.T.T.E. withdrew from Vadamaratchi on 13 July. On the same day a group
of the notorious Black Shirts, a unit of the Sri Lankan Army trained in
Pakistan, moved from Polikandy towards Navindil looking into houses and
killing the aged who were left behind. According to an engineer from
that area, at least 20 persons, nearly all above 70, were shot dead.

        It may be assumed that India had no foreknowledge of the
L.T.T.E.'s attack on the night of 5th July. Indian officials were
critical. Members of the Indian Red Cross team were amongst those
trapped in Vadamaratchi. Reports at that time spoke of a heated argument
within the L.T.T.E. over whether its members in Vadamaratchi should be
ordered to stay or be withdrawn. With hardly any civilians left, it had
become difficult to remain there. If the event worked to the advantage
of India, it was an unintended consequence of the L.T.T.E.'s action, and
the Sri Lankan army's ineptness in dealing with civilians.

8.2        The Accord, Colonisation and

      Human Rights

The process which began with the Indian airdrop on 4 June resulted in
the Indo-Sri Lanka accord of 29th July. The ideas contained in the deal
envisaged for the Tamils were similar to those put forward by the late
Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's special envoy G. Parthasarathy. The
Northern and Eastern Provinces were to be linked for a year with the
permanency of the link to be decided by a referendum in the East a year
later. In the Eastern Province, the population was divided into Tamils
42%, Muslims (also Tamil speaking) 34% and Sinhalese 24%. The last group
had come in mainly through colonisation over the last 40 years.
According to a senior official who worked for the first such scheme, the
Gal Oya project, in the 1940's, when the houses in the scheme were ready
for occupation the first offer was made to people in the locality. The
official had gone about contacting District Revenue Officers (or
D.R.O.s) in and around Batticaloa calling for volunteers. The response
from the Tamils had been poor. Offers were then made elsewhere and large
numbers of Sinhalese came from areas such as Kegalle. Within 18 years
they started paying income tax. At this point, the government of Ceylon
could not be blamed. But this set a pattern. Alarm bells started ringing
when politics acquired an increasingly chauvinistic note. Some of the
worst violence against Tamils, during the 1958 race riots, came from
Sinhalese in the colonisation schemes at Gal Oya and Padaviya. In the
meantime movements to defend the Tamil homeland had come into existence.
Prominent amongst the early leaders was the late Prof. C.
Suntheralingam, former Mathematics teacher at the Ceylon University,
ex-Minister and M.P. for the frontier electorate of Vavuniya. Together
with the ideology that Ceylon was for the majority Sinhalese had also
arisen crusaders amongst leading Sinhalese wanting to populate Tamil
areas with Sinhalese. Government policy too naturally veered in this
direction. Attempts to settle the matter through the Bandaranaike -
Chelvanayakam pact of 1957 and the Dudley Senanayake - Chelvanayakam
pact of 1965 failed because of a lack of decision amongst the two Prime
Ministers resulting from pressure invoking the Sinhalese-Buddhist
ideology.

        The Buddhist clergy propagated the ideology that Ceylon was a
land sacred to the Buddha and the chosen repository of his teachings.
The chosen guardians were of course the Sinhalese people. Professor
Leslie Goonewardene (in "Ethnicity and Social Change in Sri Lanka,"
Social Scientists Association, 1979) argues that the term Sinhala in the
ancient chronicle Mahavamsa, actually referred to a particular dynasty
that was then favoured by the Buddhist clergy. The priestly chroniclers
of the 4th century A.D. presented a version of history that attempted to
justify through reference to antiquity, a symbiotic relationship between
themselves and a particular dynasty. Over the coming centuries of
migration from India, assimilation, comings, goings, and transformation
of both language and religion; the group of persons referred to as
Sinhala underwent changes according to the political ends to which it
was put to use. These ends were usually determined by the need to
preserve and advance the interests represented by the Buddhist Sangha.
Ironically, the allegedly chosen and exclusive group represented today
by the term Sinhala is made up to the extent of 40% by caste groups
(Karawe, Durawe, Navandanno, and Salagama) who trace their origins in
South India to about 450 - 800 years back. Although current popular
Buddhism has assimilated and legitimised the religious practices and
cults of waves of migrants, the Sinhalese-Buddhist combination today
represents something aggressive and unpleasant. It seeks to drive
minorities to the wall. It was natural that the Buddhist clergy should
form the vanguard in the cause of populating Tamil areas with Sinhalese.
Such activities had as little to do with Buddhism as the Crusades with
Christianity.

        By the early 1970's the Sinhalese squatter townships of
Sirimapura, Abhayapura, Mihindapura, and Pattispura had come into
existence in Trincomalee. These became a major irritant to the Tamils
during the race riots of 1977 and during and after July 1983. From 1977
government ministries used their facilities to provide employment for
Sinhalese in Trincomalee. Prominent amongst such ministers were Cyril
Mathew (Scientific Affairs and Industries) and Gamini Dissanayake
(Lands, Irrigation and Power). From 1983, colonisation acquired a more
terrifying aspect. Many shops in Trincomalee town were taken over after
the Tamil owners had been driven out. The same thing was being done to
houses and lands. The law and order machinery for redress was spiked as
far as the Tamils went. From 1985, the army was used in large scale
evictions of Tamils. Scenes of unbelievable devastation are still
evident as one drives into Trincomalee through Pankulam, Anuradhapura
junction and Uppuveli. Things were not helped when Mr. Lalith
Athulathmudali, the National Security Minister, announced in Parliament
in December 1984 that the government was hoping, in a move towards
finding a solution to the ethnic problem, to settle a large number of
Sinhalese in the Tamil areas. Many of the prospective settlers were to
be drawn from fishermen and ex-convicts. To this period may be traced
the first attacks on Sinhalese settlers by Tamil militants.

        Tamil - Muslim relations in the Batticaloa district had been
fairly good. The evidence of many Western journalists describes how the
government fomented trouble between Tamils and Muslims in Batticaloa as
a measure to contain the Tamil insurgency.

        The foregoing digression briefly describes how complex and
anarchic the problems of the East had become. The Tamils felt cheated.
There were now many Sinhalese who regarded the East as their home. The
Muslims were confused and in a quandary. The actions of the government
had made it easier for the Tamils, in their minds, to condone attacks on
the Sinhalese civilian population which was regarded as an
ultra-military arm of government policy. The bitter experience through
which some of the Tamil militant leaders were born has been alluded to
earlier. The East had changed qualitatively from the time of
Parthasarathy's visits in 1983.

        The East was the weak link in the Accord of July 1987. On the
surface, the position on the North-East linkage seemed a compromise
between Tamil and Sinhalese positions, aimed at providing the L.T.T.E.
with a face saving formula to accept the Accord. Though perhaps well
meaning, the Indian negotiators do not seem to have paid much attention
to the complexities of the East. Many leading Tamils would have
preferred the North and East to have separate provincial councils. They
felt that the Tamils, Sinhalese, and the Muslims of the East had to live
with each other and left to themselves, would find the most rational
basis on which to co-exist. The Muslims of the East had already
expressed a desire to go a separate way from the Muslims of the Western
seaboard. They recognised that they had different interests. One senior
Tamil civil servant pointed out that for reasons of economic
self-interest at least, the Sinhalese in the East will have a vested
interest in stopping further Sinhalese colonisation. But if the Tamils
of the North, particularly from Jaffna, were to have a commanding voice
in the East, the Eastern Tamils may tend to gang up with them against
the Muslims, who in turn would tend to gang up with the Sinhalese
against the Tamils. The resulting instability may then provide the
centre with room to interfere.

        Substantive issues such as colonisation were left as a matter
for further talks. There was also a referendum hanging over the East
which would decide the fate of the linkage in a year's time. If all
parties were to act cynically in terms of their perceived interests, the
government would try to push Sinhalese colonisation in the East
surreptitiously using its machinery and would try to sour relations
between Muslims and Tamils; and the Tamil militants would try to create
conditions which would pave the way for a mass exodus of Sinhalese. To
some extent all these happened. The Accord provided for the presence in
the North and East of an Indian Peace Keeping Force (I.P.K.F.) to ensure
its implementation. Some role for such a force was necessary.

        There were two key factors that placed the Accord on a weak
footing. First, it did not provide for a mechanism to correct human
rights violations. Thus it also ignored the primacy of reaching a
democratic consensus. In time, the Accord tended to look more and more
like a strait-jacket imposed on the people of the island. In the months
that followed the Accord, the Indian Army in the Tamil areas and the Sri
Lankan forces in the South, would be led to seeking political solutions
through military means that involved gross violations of human rights,
making a political solution even more unattainable. (See sections 8, 9
and 10.4 of Volume 2).

                The second factor that weakened the Accord, is related
to the first. It is the question of whether President Jayewardene
enjoyed the legitimacy to negotiate with India on such an important
matter. In answering this, one is left with little doubt, if one looks
at the growing repression over the past ten years, and the methods used
to perpetuate power, such as regular constitutional changes and the 1982
referendum.

8.3    The end of a Long Road to Nowhere

As for the Sinhalese people, it finally began to dawn on them that they
had been on a long road to nowhere. With them doubts gave way to
euphoria with the successful launching of Operation Liberation. This
reached a peak when the fishing vessels carrying the Indian Red Cross
meekly turned back. Sabre rattling statements by senior politicians and
newspaper columnists were the order of the day. With the Indian airdrop
of relief supplies, euphoria gave way to indignation, followed by a long
hangover during which doubts re-emerged. It was perhaps easier for a
Sinhalese living outside Ceylon to see the unreality of the government's
approach in the light of how dangerously out of tune they were with the
rest of the world. In contrast the Tamils generally felt that it was a
great thing to gain international sympathy by hook or by crook, without
themselves doing anything positive in the meantime.

        We quote below an extract from an article which appeared in the
Weekend of 19 July 1987 giving some reflections on the 4th anniversary
of the 1983 race riots. The article "Still at square one four years
after?" by Kumudini Hettiaratchchi is made all the more remarkable by
its having appeared in the Weekend:

Mea culpas during the last four years have been of no avail. What
positive action has been taken to redeem this country's image to what it
was before the debacle? The Sri Lankans had been thought of as a nation
of peaceful and tolerant people comprising a multiracial and
multi-religious community. The recent developments, not only in the
regional scene but also in the international sphere regarding the ethnic
crisis, create serious doubts as to whether we have been successful in
retrieving our lost image.

        What does the world think of Sri Lanka today? Has the government
campaign to propagate the truth of the real position been a success?
Have we been able to impress the world that in the stand taken by the
majority community in the country we have held up the ideal that in the
relationships between the various communities, particularly the Tamils,
the virtue of justice and not that of charity should be the foundation
and the norm?

        "Recently, I had the opportunity of meeting and discussing our
ethnic problem with a number of persons in the United Kingdom. Those who
made observations belonged to different nationalities. The general
opinion was vacillating between a military solution and a political
settlement. On several occasions I was asked whether Sri Lanka was
interested in settling the ethnic conflict once and for all.

        "In fact there is a very serious misconception among some of the
people there that we are thinking of ourselves as a chosen people. It
was tragic that some experienced and senior journalists there too had
formed the impression that the ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka would never
be settled because of diehard attitudes. It is a tragedy that even
though the world community was initially shocked by the Pettah bomb
blast, which killed over 100 innocent persons and injured several
hundred others, the inexcusable slaying of 30 Buddhist monks and the
brutal murders of numbers of harmless villagers in Arantalawa and other
areas in the North and the East, every country in the world had
reiterated that the Sri Lanka should go in only for a political solution
to the ethnic problem.

        "In the present perspective Operation Liberation was regarded by
them as an 'ill-advised move.' Instead of helping the country regain
some of its lost reputation for loving peaceful methods of settling
disputes, it seemed to have created the impression that Sri Lanka was
only paying lip service to a 'political solution.'"

      "The offensive, it appears, had pushed this country further into
the abyss of isolation among the comity of nations. Several journalists
and others in the United Kingdom were generally "cold" towards even the
violation of Sri Lanka's airspace by India dropping food aid from in
planes escorted by Mirage Fighters. The "mercy mission" violation of Sri
Lankan territorial integrity by India was not condemned as it should
have been by the West. It was only mildly deplored as it were by the
European Parliament. A family that I knew in Oxford expressed horror at
what they had seen on a programme on British television three weeks
previously. "How could the Sinhalese be so brutal?," the materfamilias
asked me. The man of the house was adamant that there had been
"firebombings" in the North. "What of the children shown with severe
burns?" he asked. "Who is responsible for ordering Vietnam tactics in
your country?" he asked me in the presence of several journalists from a
number of countries, he had invited for supper.

      "A journalist listening in on our conversation laughingly quoted,
"Where every prospect pleases and only man is vile" about Sri Lanka. In
Britain it was also difficult to explain the "arbitrary arrests" and the
alleged "disappearances" of some of those arrested.

      When one compares the protest from the international community in
the case of Afghanistan, Grenada and earlier Kampuchea, not to mention
the Nicaraguan crisis, with our own ethnic debacle, one comes to the
inescapable conclusion that there had to be serious rethinking on the
absolute necessity for an early settlement.

      But the most important and essential ingredient for peace, is
honesty and sincerity."
