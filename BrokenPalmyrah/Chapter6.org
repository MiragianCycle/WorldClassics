Chapter 6

1987: THE BUBBLE BURSTS

6.1Retreat to Jaffna

The L.T.T.E. showed little interest in negotiating on the basis of the
December 19th proposals. With Prabhakaran's arrival, the public felt
that Kittu as Jaffna leader would in due course be eclipsed.

As the year commenced the Special Task Force (S.T.F.) made rapid gains
in the East forcing the L.T.T.E. out of several of its strongholds and
establishing new camps. Describing the terror of civilians, a member of
the Batticaloa citizens committee said:"The S.T.F. was given a blank
cheque to kill, assault, torture and imprison civilians. This was used
with terrifying effect. Foreign correspondents were kept out."

In the North, outside Jaffna, all areas populated by civilians were
overrun by late February and several new camps were established by the
Sri Lankan army. The recently built up air power had been used to good
effect. India had apparently placed restrictions on the L.T.T.E.
acquiring an effective counter to the government's air power. It is
noteworthy that the Sri Lankan army's attempt nearly a year earlier, to
establish control over the Kilinochchi district had failed when all
militant groups were active. A worried L.T.T.E., withdrew most of its
men from other areas and concentrated them in Jaffna. Significantly, key
L.T.T.E. leaders from other areas, including Mahattaya from Vavuniya,
and Radha from Mannar, made their appearance in Jaffna. This meant that
the threat to Jaffna was indeed taken seriously.

This brings us to certain aspects of the L.T.T.E.. From 1985 it had been
a common feature of all militant groups to attract a following by
successfully bringing off sensational military operations. The T.E.L.O.
which was considered a marginal group rose to prominence after its
colourful attacks on the Chavakachcheri Police Station and on a troop
train at Murukandy in December 1984 and January 1985, respectively. What
a particular group stood for became, if anything, of marginal interest.
As a corollary, the people accepted the role of spectators and often
admirers. This reciprocal development went in the direction of the
militant groups confining the people rigidly to this role. Advice was
seldom taken. The L.T.T.E. went a step further and confined the people
to the role of devotees. Those who sensed danger and wished to offer
their counsel were silenced with varying degrees of politeness. The
reduction of the people to devotees of the political religion of the
L.T.T.E. was the culmination of a process begun by the T.U.L.F. in the
early 1970's. The F.P. and later the T.U.L.F. had demanded allegiance to
one party as embodying the destiny of the Tamil nation. All others were
branded as traitors of various shades.

Its own following which the T.U.L.F. could keep in tow with rousing
speeches, the L.T.T.E. now had to manipulate by deeds of valour which
testified to its virility. The religion of the L.T.T.E. also provided
for its devotees the emotional excitement of blood sacrifice. The
sacrificial victims were those chosen by chance and sometimes by choice,
to die in operations.

              It became a regular routine that when some L.T.T.E. member
died, wailing music would be broadcast over loud speakers. The roads
would be decorated with coconut and plantain trees. Loudspeaker vehicles
would go around announcing the deaths in melodramatic tones. Then crowds
would file past the coffins by the thousands. Such occasions were used
to generate hysterical emotions. This may explain Thileepan's death by
fasting two months after the Accord. The L.T.T.E. felt a need to prove
that its members were still willing to die and that it had not lost its
grip.

        Unlike the higher religions which tended towards equality of men
and even living creatures, the L.T.T.E.'s religion was hierarchical. The
common people counted for little except as devotees. Militants from
other groups, whatever their contribution, were counted as criminals or
anti-social elements. Only L.T.T.E. members could make sacrifices, be
counted as martyrs, and become gods in a heavenly place reserved for
them. Such a creed was expressed in one of Thileepan's last statements.

                One should not under-rate such a religion which has a
resemblance to the official religion of the Third Reich. The power of
such a religion to captivate men's minds, make them forget all norms of
civilisation and morality and weld them together as a hysterical and
destructive force, is enormous. But most Tamil civilians were looking
for security. Little did they realise that what the L.T.T.E. was
offering them was permanent conflict, destruction and suicide, for
accepting which they were not going to be thanked. Events of the coming
months were to make this abundantly clear.

                Following the Sri Lankan army's rapid advances in
January 1987, the L.T.T.E. felt a pressing need to hit back. On the 14th
of February an ingenious attempt was made on the Navatkuli army camp.
The Andreisz Company which was located next to the Navatkuli camp used
to supply drinking water to the Sri Lankan army. The L.T.T.E. took over
the company's water bowser and placed charges in its tank, which would
explode when the water dropped to a certain level. According to reports
the water tank by some freak developed a leak. The bowser was taken into
a lane at Kaithady. According to one report a welder was brought to
repair the leak. By some accident the bowser exploded. Amongst the ten
L.T.T.E. persons killed were three senior leaders, Kugan, Curdles and
Vasu. The presence of Kugan who was second in command to Prabhakaran and
close to him, suggests that Prabhakaran was in direct command of the
operation. Forty civilians were reportedly killed. The operation had to
be abandoned. The L.T.T.E. announced the deaths through loud speakers
and its notice boards. A disturbing aspect of this announcement was that
the civilian deaths were not mentioned.

                Even the newspapers gave very little publicity to the
civilian deaths. This set the precedent for developments to come. Not
surprisingly it may be noted that both the Sri Lankan government and the
L.T.T.E. were superstitious. The digits in dates normally chosen by the
L.T.T.E. for major operations would add up to five, whereas for the
government it would add up to eight. People would normally expect
L.T.T.E.'s initiatives on the 5th, 14th and 23rd of a month and
government initiatives on the 8th, 17th or 26th of a month.

                The government resumed aerial bombing of Jaffna on the
7th of March. A massive barrage of shelling from Jaffna Fort killed 17
civilians at Windsor Theatre junction and injured 50. A shell also fell
on the hospital for the first time.

                In the early hours of the morning on Monday, 30 March,
shells again fell on the Jaffna hospital. Eight patients were killed in
Ward 19/20. Two nurses and an attendant were injured. It may be noted
that the ward affected was a medical ward having elderly heart patients.
It should also be noted here that this shelling was strongly condemned
by India. When the National Security Minister suggested that the shell
was fired by the L.T.T.E., noting the fact that the shells came from the
direction of the Fort, the Indian ambassador J. N. Dixit is said to have
remarked sarcastically that the L.T.T.E. has a special shell which goes
forward and then turns back.

                On the night of 30 March, a bomb was thrown at the
L.T.T.E.'s Jaffna leader Mr. Kittu, while he was visiting a friend
living on 2nd Cross Street, Jaffna. One of his body guards, a youth from
Mannar, was killed. Kittu himself was admitted to the hospital and had
one of his legs amputated. The news came out that some prisoners had
died on the evening of the following day at the L.T.T.E.'s Brown Road
camp. The B.B.C. broadcast a news item which claimed shortly afterwards
that a large number of prisoners held by the L.T.T.E. had been killed,
following the attempt on Kittu. Some sources put the number at 70. In an
atmosphere of mounting rumours, the L.T.T.E. issued a press statement on
the 6th of April claiming that prisoners grabbed some weapons and tried
to escape and that in the ensuing battle, two L.T.T.E. guards and 18
prisoners were killed. A member of the E.P.R.L.F. who escaped during the
incident and later went to Batticaloa submitted an affidavit to the
following effect: "Several of us prisoners were kept in a room at the
L.T.T.E.'s Brown Road camp. In the evening Aruna (L.T.T.E.'s former
Batticaloa leader) burst into the room and opened fire at us with an
automatic weapon. Three of us managed to escape through another door and
get away. Eighteen were killed during that incident."

                Aruna is known to have been close to Kittu. In
publishing the L.T.T.E.'s statement on the incident, the Jaffna daily
Murasoli, of 6 April, 1987 announced in banner headlines: "18 Criminals
killed." This represented new levels of opportunism in journalism. The
L.T.T.E. statement had not claimed that the dead were criminals. The
L.T.T.E. is believed to have killed several other E.P.R.L.F. members in
other camps at the same time. One whose death was widely talked about at
that time was E.P.R.L.F.'s Dr. Benjamin, who had worked with refugees.
The Saturday Review after consulting a senior member of the L.T.T.E.
reported that in all about 50 prisoners were killed. The identities and
affiliations of Kittu's would-be-assassins were never revealed.

                On 2 April, the attack by the L.T.T.E. on a mini-camp at
Valvettithurai was repulsed with the L.T.T.E. suffering five dead. An
ambulance carrying five persons injured by shelling from Pt. Pedro
hospital to Jaffna was shelled by helicopter at Vallai-veli, killing the
patients and the ambulance driver.

                A senior figure in Jaffna put across to Minister
Thondaman the idea of a cease-fire over the traditional Sinhalese-Tamil
new year, to be used to set the scene for negotiations in order to
restore peace. Mr. Thondaman asked the cabinet for a fortnight's cease
fire. The cabinet agreed to a unilateral cease fire of nine days from
11th - 19th April. This was rejected by V. Prabhakaran who stated that
he would consider a cease fire after the 20th of April. It was to be
expected that such a response from the L.T.T.E. would have been seen by
the outside world as puerile diplomacy bordering on intransigence.
Though the senior figure in Jaffna felt that the government's
announcement of the cease fire was sincerely intended, Prabhakaran's
stand had widespread sympathy from a people who had come to believe that
all the blame for the situation lay with the government. The aerial
bombing and shelling of the civilian population had made the people
deeply distrustful of the government. Reports of government breaches of
the cease fire started appearing in the Jaffna press. Given the
situation, whenever government forces shelled, it became difficult to
determine who provoked and who retaliated.

                On 16 April 1987, 150 Sinhalese, many of them civilians
returning to Trincomalee after new year festivities at Anuradhapura,
were off-loaded from their buses and massacred at Kituluttuwa. The
L.T.T.E. was widely blamed and the government claimed that the massacre
was led by L.T.T.E.'s Pulendran. Shortly afterwards, on 21 April, a car
bomb exploded at the Pettah bus stand in Colombo, killing over 100
civilians. The attack was widely attributed to a Tamil militant group,
believed to be either the E.R.O.S. or the L.T.T.E.. International
opinion drifted away from sympathy for Tamils, towards approving a Sri
Lankan government crack down on Tamil militants.

                In the early hours of 22nd April, an L.T.T.E. party
under Radha's command attacked the jetty at K.K.S. where cement bags
from Lanka Cement Ltd. (L.C.L.) were being loaded into a waiting ship.
This is again an example of the L.T.T.E.'s daring and capacity to
improvise in order to stage sensational suicidal attacks. These attacks
were usually accompanied by a heavy civilian toll and made the
government more brutal and intransigent. It put the civilian population
in further jeopardy while providing grist for the L.T.T.E. to further
its religious appeal. The security precautions at the entrance to the
jetty were elaborate. Lorries loaded with cement went North from the
L.C.L. plant and had to queue up as they reached the K.K.S. - Keerimalai
Road before crossing into the premises of the harbour which were under
Sri Lankan army control. As the lorry that had just unloaded came out,
the first lorry in the waiting queue crossed the road into the harbour
premises. During the crossing a security officer from L.C.L. walked some
distance with the lorry. The L.T.T.E.'s plan was a high risk, ingenious
strategy and hence unexpected by the army. According to sources within
the L.T.T.E., its members compete with each other to volunteer for such
suicidal missions.

                L.T.T.E. men were hidden in a lorry with a wall of
cement bags to disguise it as one going to unload. The lorry was parked
in a lane towards the land side, a few yards from the crossing point,
but hidden from the army. Calculating that the concentration of the army
sentries will be at a low ebb in the early hours of the morning, as a
lorry which had finished unloading came out of the harbour, the L.T.T.E.
lorry made a dash and got in front of the one which was to enter. This
went unnoticed by the army sentries who were poised on the water tank.
The L.C.L. security guard was too shocked to react and followed on foot
the L.T.T.E. lorry which had been allowed inside.

                Once in, the L.T.T.E. men opened fire killing 18
soldiers, and were soon out again. The army was angry. They got hold of
five L.C.L. security guards and killed them. One of those killed was
Sergeant Mylvaganam, who had earlier been a police sergeant. Another
L.C.L. foreman was dragged out of the bathroom and shot. At the time of
the attack 70 labourers were employed in loading cement bags at the
jetty. Fortunately for them, the Sinhalese ship's captain, fearing
reprisals against them, took them aboard and put out to sea. These
workers were put ashore several hours later after the captain obtained
the assurance that the workers would not be molested. The Sri Lankan
government overplayed its propaganda card when it wrapped bullet bands
around the bodies of the L.C.L. security officers killed and displayed
them on the state television Rupavahini as terrorists killed. Any
intelligent viewer would have found the body of 55-year-old Sergeant
Mylvaganam with greying hair, appearing as that of a youthful terrorist,
too much to swallow. A more intelligent way of lying would have been to
avoid the extras and blame the killing of Tamil security officers on the
L.T.T.E.. This again indicates how the government treated the whole
question as a military problem and was not interested in making
overtures to Tamil opinion. This worked to the L.T.T.E.'s benefit.. If
the government troops had been disciplined to avoid reprisals against
civilians, it could have exposed the futility of the L.T.T.E.'s action.
But the government had very different ideas. The next six weeks were to
see an unleashing of random impersonal terror against Tamil civilians.

                The people of K.K.S. and the workers at the two cement
plants had been dismayed by the L.T.T.E.'s action. The L.T.T.E. had
given the workers at the cement plants an assurance that it would not
interfere with their work. Working relations between the army and the
cement plants had been fairly good. The citizens' committees in the area
had worked out an unwritten agreement between the L.T.T.E. and the army,
allowing the latter free use of the K.K.S. - Palaly Road. This enabled
the civilians to stay on in that area. Now all this came to an end. With
an increasing number of landmine attacks by the L.T.T.E., the army took
to shooting at civilians. Several civilians were shot dead, including
Dr. Viswaranjan who was returning home to K.K.S. on 25 April, after
working at the Jaffna hospital. This led to the total exodus of
civilians from K.K.S., Myliddy and Maviddapuram. On the meaningless
suffering of all these people, aided by the Sri Lankan government's
intransigent brutality, was built the expanding edifice of the L.T.T.E.
religion. The random shelling and aerial bombing of the Tamil civilian
population commenced on 22 April. Emotional support for the L.T.T.E.
increased. People asked what India was doing. A senior Indian official
told a newspaper editor, that after the Pettah bomb blast and the
Kituluttuwa massacre, India had lost the moral right to protest. The
destructive policies of the L.T.T.E. and the Sri Lankan government
received mutual sustenance from each other.

                The people around K.K.S. had for a year tried a policy
of live and let live with both the L.T.T.E. and the Sri Lankan army.
Through its supporters within the cement plants the L.T.T.E. had enjoyed
some privileges there. A workshop engineer had resigned and gone abroad
in January 1987 after an L.T.T.E. party gave him their "first warning."
The engineer's professional pride did not allow him to give in to
certain demands. He had also been alarmed by the readiness with which
people played with the safety of their colleagues for the sake of power
and influence. The policy of live and let live without a principled
stand was doomed to failure. The cement plants were closed on 22 April.

                Another incident which influenced the local mind was the
landmine attack by the L.T.T.E. on an army patrol on 25 March 1987.
Subsequently the severed foot of a Sri Lankan soldier with a boot on it
was exhibited successively at the Maviddapuram temple and Tellipallai
junction. For its part the Sri Lankan army shelled these two places on
successive nights. On the first night a temple priest lost his leg. At
Tellipallai junction, Mr. Venugopal was killed. On the 31 March, the
L.T.T.E.'s Jaffna leader Mr. Kittu lost a leg in a grenade attack. Many
of the Hindu folk at Maviddapuram, steeped in a belief in karma, formed
their own conclusions. Nevertheless, the exhibition of gore had
attracted sizeable crowds. This followed the exhibition of the dead
bodies of nine Sri Lankan soldiers at Kandasamy Kovil four months
before. There was taking place a transformation of sensibilities. Many
Hindus were disgusted, but silent.

                The Sri Lankan government commenced random shelling of
the civilian population in Jaffna, together with aerial bombing on 22
April. One could hear shells falling in quick succession in widely
separated places, usually around 6:30 a.m. and 6:30 p.m. Most would
quickly take their families into the house or into a trench if they had
one, and say their prayers. The aerial bombing was often off the mark.
The Sri Lankan air force tried four times to bomb an L.T.T.E. camp in
Pt. Pedro situated in the crowded market area, and finally finished the
job with a bulldozer a month later, after taking over Vadamaratchi at
the end of May. About a hundred civilians were killed up to 26 May as a
result of the bombing and shelling.

                On the 1st of May, the L.T.T.E. defied the government
ban on May day processions countrywide, and organised a massive rally
commencing at Urumpirai junction, and ending with a public meeting at
Kandasamy Kovil. Vans, buses and lorries were commandeered and were used
to ferry people from distant places. L.T.T.E. cadres knocked on doors
and asked people to come. Some flatly refused. Others went with varying
combinations of consent and fear. The majority who went, did so
willingly or out of curiosity.

                At the meeting, the L.T.T.E.'s rising star and Kugan's
brother, Yogi, gave a rousing speech. It was a frank statement of what
the L.T.T.E. was offering its subjects. Yogi said: "Even if 35 lakhs [1]
¹ should die, we will not be deterred from our goal of Tamil Eelam." He
went on to indicate that a small fraction of the present population of
Tamils is enough to people the state of Tamil Eelam. Few were alarmed by
such frankness. The Tamil man was far from being suicidal, although the
L.T.T.E.'s critics had come to term its brand of politics, cyanide or
suicide politics. The Tamil man very much loved material security.
(Curiously, the L.T.T.E. again and again stressed the need to safeguard
territory. There was no corresponding stress on safeguarding life.) The
fact that nearly every household in Jaffna had constructed an air raid
shelter at an average cost of Rs. 1000/- showed that they were unlikely
candidates for suicide. For sometime, disenchantment with the manner of
the L.T.T.E.'s campaign and its indifference to the fate of civilians
had been expressed by affected people from Mannar, the Eastern Province
and parts of Jaffna. These had fallen on deaf ears amongst articulate
folk in suburban Jaffna. For many, the manner in which the L.T.T.E. had
ruled Jaffna was acceptable. There were disappearances -- a minor
problem. But people could make money unmolested. Travel agents,
employment agencies, those who ran coach services to Colombo, and
contractors continued to make their money. The coach operators and the
L.T.T.E. found it mutually advantageous to cut train services to
Colombo. (Coach fares came down from Rs. 200/- to Rs. 65/- when train
services resumed after the Accord. The Sri Lankan army too had good
relations with the operators.) But now was approaching a time when all
this might have to change and misery was going to be the common lot.
When the L.T.T.E. started proceeding alone in May 1986, it had offered
the people of Jaffna, "order within and security from attacks by the Sri
Lankan forces." This worked well for a while, but had crumbled with
time.

                The Sri Lankan army had been tightening its noose by the
establishment of new camps at Vasavilan, Kattuvan and Mandaitivu over
the months. The Sri Lankan strategy was simple. It would create
diversions from various points, such as Jaffna, Pt. Pedro, Kayts,
V.V.T., Elephant Pass and Palaly. One of these would be the real column
that would advance under air cover and establish a new camp. Even in the
latter half of 1986, support from the E.P.R.L.F., E.R.O.S., P.L.O.T.E.
and T.E.A. had been crucial in countering the Sri Lankan advance, though
the L.T.T.E. hated to admit it. The counter-strategy developed by the
militant groups was to have sentries posted with walkie-talkies. When an
advance was sighted, the main body of fighting men, who would be mobile
in pickups and mini-vans, would be summoned. This was effective up to a
point. But in 1987, the L.T.T.E. was clearly over-stretched. When the
Sri Lankan army advanced to Kattuvan on 28 February with just one
covering helicopter, hardly any resistance was offered. According to a
resident of that area, the sentry had radioed Kittu for reinforcements.
He was aghast when Kittu simply ordered him to chase the army back.

                On an earlier occasion, the army had attacked Kattuvan
by land and air, causing the L.T.T.E. sentry to flee. The army then
withdrew. In the evening Kittu arrived on the scene in his car. He left
his men and walked alone into the dusk. The short and balding figure sat
down by himself to reflect, his brow furrowed. He had dispatched tens of
C.I.A., Mossad and C.I.D. agents in his time, without giving it any more
thought than he would in deciding to have a cup of tea. Here was the
man, who during the Vijitharan affair kept the University dons
awestruck, while he poured out his contradictions. Their silence was as
if to say, "Yes, General." The highest in Jaffna had waited on him. He
had played with the lives of others and had gambled with his own.
Mendis, his own friend and Jaffna leader of the P.L.O.T.E., had died in
his custody. Friendship did not stand in the way of such things. Amongst
his men, there were those who resented his flamboyance. But in battle,
they trusted his leadership as few others' was trusted. We may never
know what passed through his mind. For the first time, perhaps, he was a
worried man. Did he have a premonition that his rising star would soon
have its setting?

                Perhaps, the development of the L.T.T.E. leadership is
related to something deeply ingrained in the human psyche appearing in
the evolution myths of ancient lore. Many of the L.T.T.E. leaders had
lived like the ancient gods. Like Wotan in Niebelung's Ring and Keat's
Hyperion, gods who reach their limits of action must wish for self
annihilation. This is probably just a fancy that may explain one aspect
of their development. Motives are complex things and the L.T.T.E.
leadership was moving in several directions at the same time. Many of
its leaders, Mahattaya, Kittu and Kumarappa, were either married or were
on the verge of it. Their leader Prabhakaran was the father of two. The
leadership had also demonstrated on several occasions that it was
interested in an arrangement where it would have settled power. In late
1986 Kittu had made overtures to leading personalities and the media in
the South. There had been a good deal of comings and goings and much
secret talk. After the Accord of July 1987 much of the L.T.T.E.'s
performance had been a bid for power. The agreement reached with India
during secret negotiations at the the time of the fast, talked almost
exclusively of power. In fact, they wanted exclusive power, and to this
end, they pushed their gambler's luck to the brink. But the five demands
put forward during Thileepan's fast to death, of September 1987 had
nothing about demands for power. When the L.T.T.E. wanted something, it
was prepared to play with the lives of its own men and with those of
civilians. The impasse resulting from the suicide in custody of 12
L.T.T.E. members on 5 October 1987 and the subsequent massacre of
Sinhalese, was part of a pattern. By provoking a crisis the L.T.T.E.
seemed to hope for a decisive outcome, with perhaps help from Tamil
Nadu. Their message seemed to say: "Accept our terms, for if you try
anything else, we can sour things for you."

                When India took on the L.T.T.E., Prabhakaran said in a
message: "We have been forced into fighting to protect ourselves. India
must assume full responsibility for harm resulting to the people." This
was indeed, a most queer stand for someone who claimed leadership and on
whom it fell to protect the people. The war dragged on. After the worst
killing was over, the L.T.T.E.'s deputy leader Mahattaya, in a letter to
the Indian authorities, sued for an end to the fighting. A key demand
was a return to the status quo of 28 September which offered 7 out of 12
places on the interim council for the L.T.T.E.. Behind all the gore and
the Homeric drama, there was a bid for something tangible -- namely
power. There were the usual somersaults of traditional politics. For
this reason it will be wrong to romanticise the L.T.T.E.. Every human
being is ridiculous most of the time. Lord Byron, the most romanticised
poet, confesses this frankly in his work Don Juan.

                At the same time, the leaders of the L.T.T.E. were proud
men. They were proud of what they had achieved and did not like being
trifled with. India recognised this up to a point. The Tigers were
prepared to risk all they had in pursuit of a goal, in addition to
risking everyone else. The religious element in the L.T.T.E. has already
been mentioned. They also invoked other gods. Kittu was a pious Hindu,
who was also given to lighting candles at Christian shrines. The element
of calculation increased, the higher one went up the hierarchy. At the
bottom, there was an unquestioning religious zeal facilitated by the
impressionable boyishness of the new recruits.

                In May 1986, the L.T.T.E.'s admirers in Jaffna viewed
them as a military force which offered them physical and material
security. Between January and May 1987, a series of military reverses
ensured that this offer was no longer good. The L.T.T.E. had compensated
for this by substituting a religious appeal. When Yogi announced on 1
May 1987 that even if 35 lakhs die, they would stay their course until
Eelam is achieved, people took it as the metaphorical expression of a
religious sentiment. This was after all common enough in these parts.
Politicians in the South had sworn to fight India down to the last drop
of their blood. Even those members of the public who were the L.T.T.E.'s
most ardent supporters did not relish the thought of departing this
world. Yet they applauded. That the prospect of mass suicide was being
seriously held out by the L.T.T.E. did not really sink in. The
L.T.T.E.'s saying one thing and the public hoping for and understanding
something else, was to have several more repetitions. No one looking
back can complain that the L.T.T.E. had not made itself clear. The May
day rally was held in the precincts of the Nallur Kanthasamy temple. The
choice of venue itself was a sign of things to come. A massive crowd,
numbering several tens of thousands had been brought to Kanthasamy Kovil
in defiance of a government ban. The possibility of a shell attack from
the Fort or firing from a helicopter was very real. Had this happened
the scene of disaster would have made good propaganda. The fortunate
fact that sanity prevailed and such an attack did not take place was
again publicised as a victory for the L.T.T.E.. It had successfully
defied a ban which was observed in the rest of the country. Either way
the L.T.T.E. would have won. Yogi's words literally meant that the human
cost was immaterial. Civilian casualties were used for propaganda
abroad. But inside, L.T.T.E. casualties were announced with religious
fanfare, while civilian casualties received scant attention.

6.2       The Navaratne episode

It was now clear to many that the Sri Lankan government was preparing to
launch an offensive to recapture the entire peninsula. Few doubted that
they would succeed. The prospect of the entire Jaffna peninsula being
turned into a refugee camp, like the Eastern Province, was very real.
Several persons felt that a group of leading citizens should talk to the
L.T.T.E., with a view to persuading them of at least talking to the
government on the basis of the December 19th proposals. There were at
this time several channels of communication between the government and
the L.T.T.E.. One of these was the editor of the Saturday Review, Mr.
Gamini Navaratne. He had been the editor of the English Weekly published
from Jaffna during the crucial period which followed the 1983 riots.
Being Sinhalese, his role was a delicate one in which he was often
misunderstood. Having been a lobby correspondent he knew the senior
parliamentarians well. He had the ability and guts, to push his luck to
the edge in publishing news of human rights violations by the
government. Unlike editors in the West, Mr. Navaratne was aware that
restrictions were placed on journalism by the contending parties to the
conflict, all of whom had much to hide. He was keen that the truth
should somehow be brought out, and in this his performance was well
above the standards in this country. While being critical of
Jayewardene's handling of the ethnic crisis, Mr. Navaratne did have an
affectionate regard for him. He did look upon certain of the militant
leaders with a paternal affection. Among them were Kittu and Raheem of
the L.T.T.E., the E.R.O.S. leader, Balakumar, and the late Dr. Benjamin
of the E.P.R.L.F.. He often expressed the feeling that the boys had done
a great job in standing up to the Sri Lankan forces, and yet they were
just boys who needed help in the form of mature counsel. The December
19th proposals, he felt, were a reasonable basis for negotiations, and
that unless a settlement was reached fast, Jaffna would collapse under
the strain. No doubt, events proved him right. He was forthright in
expressing these views, which were accepted by a section of the public.
But another uncharitable section of the public were deeply suspicious of
him. In the highest circles in Jaffna he was accused of being an agent
of one kind or the other including being J. R.'s agent. Now that Kittu
and Raheem were under a cloud the leadership of the L.T.T.E. was
suspicious of him. Mr. Navaratne's recent attempts to talk to the
L.T.T.E., regarding the December 19th proposals had met with rebuffs.
Where others had taken the hint, Navaratne was not so easily put off.

                On 11 May, a group of persons met independently at the
university to discuss an approach to the L.T.T.E. with a view to
averting the looming prospect. Navaratne heard of this meeting and
arrived at the university. He spent a few minutes giving his views on
the subject and went away after wishing them luck. It was on this
occasion that the full extent of the L.T.T.E.'s spy network at the
University was revealed. A highly fanciful rumour was sent out by some
senior persons to the effect that Mr. Navaratne was at the University to
organise a petition against the L.T.T.E., that was to be presented at
the S.A.A.R.C. Editors' Conference. It was a shocking revelation that
both amongst the staff and students, colleagues were spying on
colleagues, with little thought of the possibility that they might put
their colleagues in grave danger. Navaratne was followed and placed
under arrest by a medical student. The manner of his arrest was
disrespectful and gave no consideration to his invaluable services.
After an investigation led by Mahattaya himself, the L.T.T.E. was
convinced that they had been fed with bad information, by some of their
so-called senior advisors. Mr. Navaratne was released four days later.
It was a sign of the wretched state of Jaffna that in the face of
disaster, some of its elites could do no better than to cast speculative
aspersions on a man who, after all, believed that he was doing something
for the people. Several months later, after the L.T.T.E. had lost its
position of control in the wake of the Indian offensive, some in the
L.T.T.E. recognised the value of independent journalism. A high ranker
in the L.T.T.E. told a senior citizen that they would like Mr. Navaratne
to continue his editorial work in Jaffna. The senior citizen replied:
"Had Mr. Navaratne been here on the night of 5th October, you would have
made a bonfire of him in the Jaffna Hindu College grounds." The 5th of
October was the night when the L.T.T.E. launched a manhunt against
Sinhalese residents in Jaffna.

6.3       The closing of Jaffna Hospital

Another episode pertaining to this period was the government's attempt
to close down Jaffna hospital. A letter from the Ministry of teaching
hospitals dated 27 April reached the hands of the Medical
Superintendent, Jaffna, on 3 May. This letter contained an order for him
to close the Jaffna hospital by the 8th of May. This was a sign that the
government was getting ready for an offensive. The government had
received bad publicity on account of shells falling on Jaffna hospital
and the casualties resulting from it. Many of the doctors admitted that
given the army's order to fire back when fired upon, it was inevitable
that even if the army commanders were careful, shells fired from the
Jaffna Fort would fall on Jaffna hospital. The army had the unenviable
task of maintaining a mere presence in Jaffna. For the rest, the
soldiers were cooped up and vulnerable to missiles fired from outside.
In January 1986, the army was ordered to retaliate with cannon, up to a
radius of 1 kilometre from the Jaffna fort. The commercial hub of Jaffna
and the hospital fell within this distance. This marked an escalation of
the conflict in terms of civilian cost. By the middle of 1986, shells
had been aimed at targets 3 miles from the Fort. One aimed apparently at
an L.T.T.E. camp killed the bridegroom and the bride's father when it
exploded amidst a wedding party. As time went by the shelling acquired a
more indiscriminate character. Snipers too were brought in later.
Several ordinary citizens getting about Bankshall Street and K.K.S. Road
fell victim to snipers. One army officer, regarded as a considerate man,
told a Tamil friend that they would sometimes watch from the fort in the
night in a state of fear. When they sometimes observed fire directed at
the Fort, it could easily appear to come from the hospital. At the same
time the staff at the hospital had obtained from the militants a
guarantee that their premises would not be used to fire at the army and
were certain that the guarantee had been honoured. But in such a
volatile environment, the danger to the hospital was there. A rational
way out of it would have been a truce in the Fort area. But when lethal
means are available, rationality tends to go out of the window. Cannon
came in handy when the army was in a bad temper and wished to take it
out on the civilians.

                The press in Jaffna mentioned only the shelling by the
army. But many journalists would admit that there was also constant
provocation by firing things into the Fort. If the L.T.T.E.'s conduct
during the hospital crisis of May 1987 did anything at all, it added
weight to the suspicion that its attitude towards civilians was
basically cynical.

                Cynicism was widespread in this conflict and was in the
long run destructive to all who employed it. If a landmine went off in a
remote village, the army would hit the civilians hard in the hope that
it would destroy the militants' support base. One way or the other the
militants would welcome the government action as bringing in additional
support for their cause. It was an extension of July 1983. A case of how
this cynicism deepened enmity between groups was that of a young member
of the E.P.R.L.F. from Batticaloa. He was travelling along Hospital
Road, when he got a bullet in the back. This would normally have been
associated with a sniper in the Fort. This boy later said in hospital,
that he had looked back as he lost consciousness and fell down. He had
only seen L.T.T.E. sentries. He claimed that the bullet extracted from
his body was not from a sniper rifle but was fired from an M-16. Rightly
or wrongly he had formed his conclusions and was extremely bitter.

                The order to close Jaffna hospital gave rise to
widespread shock and panic. This came at the height of indiscriminate
shelling resulting in casualties, who but for Jaffna hospital would have
faced death. The Tellipallai and Pt. Pedro hospitals too had been hit by
shells, and after the shelling of an ambulance from Pt. Pedro on 4
April, the transport of patients became a precarious activity. The short
supply of petrol added to the complications. By 6 May, Jaffna had
virtually become a ghost town. Shops shifted their goods and residents
fled their homes. This too was a tricky affair. Those lucky enough to
rent a house in the interior had to move again on discovering that the
house had once been a militant camp. Such places were considered fair
game for Sri Lankan bombers. The hospital started discharging most of
its patients from Monday the 4th of May. It is a tribute to the grit of
the common man that most services kept functioning during this fearsome
period. The banks remained open for a few hours in the mornings. Life
went on against a background of shell blasts and firing from L.T.T.E.
sentries.

                Mrs. Sivapakiam Nadarajah, a long term resident in front
of Jaffna hospital, was on 5 May, packing her things to send them away
to Chavakachcheri. One then witnessed the amazing spectacle of a
milkman, who calmly dismounted from his bicycle and rang his bell for
someone to fetch the milk. He then lazily looked up at the sky and at
the twittering birds on the trees. His whistling could be heard between
shell blasts. Three shells fell only 90 minutes later on a building
opposite the new Out-Patients' Department (O.P.D.) in the hospital,
about 40 yards to the West of Commercial bank. This demonstrated the
kind of risk involved. That the thought of death was writ large on
people's minds was evident. Asked how he came to terms with coming to
work given the risk involved; Mr. Arul Gnanaseelan, an employee of the
Commercial Bank said: "I trust in God and come to work. If He has a
purpose in keeping me alive, I will live. If it is time for me to go, it
is in His hands." Mr. Mohanachandran, another milkman, said, covering
his anxiety with a smile, that distributing milk had become a cumbersome
business. When he went to the homes of some of his customers, he had to
ring his bell for a long time and wait on the road listening to the
music of the shells. This was because many of his customers were inside
trenches. During a slight pause, the customer would cautiously emerge,
make a dash for the gate, collect his milk in a pan and then beat an
unceremonious retreat. He added: "I too spend the nights in a trench
with my family in Kopay. One must understand the feelings of those
soldiers too. They must be feeling pretty rotten after the Pettah bomb
blast and the Kitul-uttuwa massacre." The people of Jaffna can be proud,
that amongst the humble ranks of its milkmen, can be found the right
material for the world's most intrepid war correspondents.

                In the meantime, representatives from amongst the
hospital authorities and the G.M.O.A. (Government Medical Officers
Association) went to Colombo to make representations concerning the case
for Jaffna hospital. Even before the closure threat, the region's
largest hospital with 1150 beds, was down to having 550 patients. The
main body of the G.M.O.A. in Colombo was sympathetic to the need to keep
Jaffna hospital open. So was the Ministry for Teaching Hospitals, which
had even earlier argued against the closure. In consequence of their
discussions with the L.T.T.E., the doctors from Jaffna felt that the
L.T.T.E. would go along with any reasonable arrangement to keep the
hospital open. The L.T.T.E. did have sound military reasons for keeping
the hospital open. If the hospital was to be closed, the town would be
abandoned. For, this would remove all restrictions placed on Sri Lankan
military activity. The L.T.T.E. would thus lose the civilian cover which
made it possible for it to maintain a presence around Jaffna Fort. When
the news of the closure order came, the L.T.T.E. backed a demonstration
in which a large number of medical students took part. The demonstrators
demanded that the hospital staff should defy the closure order and stay
put. Some suggested that if the hospital was shelled and some doctors
got killed, it would so much the more embarrass the Sri Lankan
authorities. The doctors pointed out that things may not work that way.
A shell for instance could fall at a harmless distance away from a ward,
causing a patient a minor cut. The patients would then promptly desert
the hospital, effectively closing it. The hospital staff would then have
nothing to show for defying their ministry. The L.T.T.E. by all accounts
was worried.

                In Colombo, the Jaffna Hospital doctors received crucial
support for their cause from the Indian High Commission. Given the wide
ranging pressure, the President and the National Security Minister
agreed to lift the closure order if a fire-free zone could be negotiated
around the hospital between the L.T.T.E. and the Sri Lankan army. For
while the G.M.O.A. accepted the word of the Jaffna doctors that the
hospital to the best of their knowledge had not been used to fire at the
Jaffna Fort, the National Security ministry stood by the contrary. It
was then felt that such an agreement of a fire free zone would solve the
problem. This was a victory for common humanity. In their enthusiasm,
the doctors took it upon themselves to arrange such negotiations. It was
agreed that the telephone link between the fort and the hospital would
be restored and that Captain Kotelawela who had previously developed a
rapport with Kittu, Rahim and some other L.T.T.E. leaders would be
available at the Jaffna Fort on the afternoon of 10 May. Hopes rose
high. One of the Jaffna newspapers got wind of this from what was
thought of as a private talk and stated that the planned negotiations
were announced at a press conference at the hospital.

                At this point the L.T.T.E. pounced on the doctors. They
were found fault with for arranging meetings for the L.T.T.E. without
their authority. Further, they said, it was through the press that they
were being informed of this meeting. Apart from a possible technical
blunder involving the press, the doctors felt that they were acting for
the common good. No commitment at this time was forthcoming from the
L.T.T.E.. Later the doctors learnt from Captain Kotelawela that he had
contacted the L.T.T.E. independently and had arranged to meet with them
the following morning. Captain Kotelawela further added that he had come
on "multiple missions" and had not sounded as if the hospital matter was
amongst the key subjects. It was learnt the following morning that the
L.T.T.E. had not kept its appointment, assuming there was one, with the
Captain who had been kept impatiently waiting. Subsequently the L.T.T.E.
put forward a demand that since it could not trust the government, it
was willing to talk if 5 persons nominated by them would be present.
These included Dr. Ratnapriya, National Secretary of the G.M.O.A., and
the Rev. Fr. Yohan Devananda. The L.T.T.E. should have known that its
demand that a representative of the International Red Cross, the I.R.C.,
should be present would not be met. The government agreed to 4 of the
delegates and added that while it cannot admit an I.R.C. representative,
the L.T.T.E. could choose anyone else from this country it could trust.
The doctors suggested that the L.T.T.E. could as a compromise, suggest
an employee of the Indian High Commission.

                The L.T.T.E.'s effective rejection was protracted. In
the meantime, the matter had received so much publicity that the
government found itself unable to go ahead with the closure of the
hospital. The L.T.T.E. had played its characteristic game, abusing the
good intentions of the Jaffna doctors, the goodwill of the G.M.O.A., and
the residual decency in the government to gain its own ends. For the
moment the L.T.T.E. had won. It was to try the same gamble during
Thileepan's fast in September, win for a start, and then lose by
overplaying its hand. For the Sri Lankan government, it was the end of
the road for negotiations which it had tried perhaps half-heartedly in
deference to international opinion and some members of its cabinet. It
had strengthened its drive for a military solution to its Tamil problem
by silencing critics within and showing up the L.T.T.E. as implacable
and irresponsible in the eyes of the world. In this sense the Sri Lankan
government had not lost. For its part, the government had not behaved as
though it was dealing with human beings over whom it claimed
sovereignty. Even the Geneva convention provided for far better
treatment during war for the population on the opposing side. A senior
citizen with personal contacts at the Indian High Commission, said at
this time that India was not more than nominally interested in pushing
the December 19th proposals. It would appear that India was building up
a case for direct intervention of some kind. The decision was taken
perhaps, sometime between January and May 1987. When the Sri Lankan
government had launched an offensive earlier in the year, Prime Minister
Rajiv Gandhi of India had warned that if a political solution is not
reached, the level of violence in Sri Lanka "will" increase. The message
was not lost in Colombo. The L.T.T.E.'s actions, together with the
government reprisals against the Tamils, had served to build up India's
case.

                In one respect, the support received by the Jaffna
doctors for their cause from the Indian High Commission was fateful, as
events proved. During the Indian offensive on Jaffna later in October
that year, the Jaffna hospital authorities assumed that because India
had in the past been a friend of the hospital, she would exercise
extreme consideration for the hospital during the offensive. As it
turned out, the need for the hospital had been as great in October as it
had been in May. Several hundred persons, ordinary men, women and
children, who were victims of Indian shelling were in need of urgent
medical care. When the Indians took Jaffna town on 21st October, there
were no signs that they had given any thought to the hospital.

                A medical Consultant, reflecting on the events of May in
light of October's harrowing experiences, said: "One can now appreciate
the National Security Minister, Lalith Athulathmudali's wanting to close
Jaffna Hospital. He knew that if an attempt was to be made to take
Jaffna, while advancing from the Fort, something embarrassing was bound
to happen at the hospital. Having faced bad publicity over the years,
the Sri Lankan government was used to thinking along these lines. The
Indians did not seem to have a clue." Another Consultant-Professor on
the same subject said: "We should have closed the hospital on 11
October. But people are concerned about patients and they are used to
cutting it fine. By their past concern, the Indians had encouraged us to
do this."

                On the other hand, the Sri Lankan government had learnt
much from this experience of May. When they launched Operation
Liberation three weeks' later, they took extreme care over Pt. Pedro
hospital. The Sri Lankan army was helped in this by the fact that the
L.T.T.E. had withdrawn from the area around Pt. Pedro hospital a day
before the army advanced from Nelliady. The Indian army did not have
this advantage. One should be careful not to make comparisons from this.
A few months earlier the Sri Lankan air force had bombed the hospital at
Adampan. Adampan was a remote area in the Mannar district. The operation
in Jaffna, thanks in part to India, had to be done under the spotlight
of international publicity. The difference between Adampan and Jaffna
was well understood by the Sri Lankan government. If the L.T.T.E. had
learnt anything, it was the value of bad publicity for the other side.
During the Indian offensive of October, the L.T.T.E. would itself
commission lawyers to obtain affidavits from victims, for whose
misfortune, the L.T.T.E. must itself share the responsibility.[Top]
