** Introduction
 :PROPERTIES:
 :CUSTOM_ID: introduction
 :END:
 In the year 1914 the University Museum secured by purchase a large six
 column tablet nearly complete, carrying originally, according to the
 scribal note, 240 lines of text. The contents supply the South
 Babylonian version of the second book of the epic /ša nagba imuru/, “He
 who has seen all things,” commonly referred to as the Epic of Gilgamish.
 The tablet is said to have been found at Senkere, ancient Larsa near
 Warka, modern Arabic name for and vulgar descendant of the ancient name
 Uruk, the Biblical Erech mentioned in Genesis X. 10. This fact makes the
 new text the more interesting since the legend of Gilgamish is said to
 have originated at Erech and the hero in fact figures as one of the
 prehistoric Sumerian rulers of that ancient city. The dynastic list
 preserved on a Nippur tablet[[#d0e109][1]] mentions him as the fifth
 king of a legendary line of rulers at Erech, who succeeded the dynasty
 of Kish, a city in North Babylonia near the more famous but more recent
 city Babylon. The list at Erech contains the names of two well known
 Sumerian deities, Lugalbanda[[#d0e115][2]] and Tammuz. The reign of the
 former is given at 1,200 years and that of Tammuz at 100 years.
 Gilgamish ruled 126 years. We have to do here with a confusion of myth
 and history in which the real facts are disengaged only by conjecture.
 
 The prehistoric Sumerian dynasties were all transformed
 <<d0e120>>[[[#d0e120][208]]]into the realm of myth and legend.
 Nevertheless these rulers, although appearing in the pretentious
 nomenclature as gods, appear to have been real historic
 personages.[[#d0e122][3]] The name Gilgamish was originally written
 /^{d}Gi-bil-aga-miš/, and means “The fire god (/Gibil/) is a commander,”
 abbreviated to /^{d}Gi-bil-ga-miš/, and /^{d}Gi(š)-bil-ga-miš/, a form
 which by full labialization of /b/ to /u̯/ was finally contracted to
 /^{d}Gi-il-ga-miš/.[[#d0e166][4]] Throughout the new text the name is
 written with the abbreviation /^{d}Gi(š)/,[[#d0e177][5]] whereas the
 standard Assyrian text has consistently the writing
 /^{d}GIŠ-ṬU[[#d0e190][6]]-BAR/. The latter method of writing the name is
 apparently cryptographic for /^{d}Giš-bar-aga-(miš)/; the fire god
 /Gibil/ has also the title /Giš-bar/.
 
 A fragment of the South Babylonian version of the tenth book was
 published in 1902, a text from the period of Hammurapi, which showed
 that the Babylonian epic differed very much from the Assyrian in
 diction, but not in content. The new tablet, which belongs to the same
 period, also differs radically from the diction of the Ninevite text in
 the few lines where they duplicate each other. The first line of the new
 tablet corresponds to Tablet I, Col. V 25 of the Assyrian
 text,[[#d0e210][7]] where Gilgamish begins to relate his dreams to his
 mother Ninsun.[[#d0e219][8]] <<d0e246>>[[[#d0e246][209]]]
 
 The last line of Col. I corresponds to the Assyrian version Book I, Col.
 VI 29. From this point onward the new tablet takes up a hitherto unknown
 portion of the epic, henceforth to be assigned to the second
 book.[[#d0e249][9]]
 
 At the end of Book I in the Assyrian text and at the end of Col. I of
 Book II in the new text, the situation in the legend is as follows. The
 harlot halts outside the city of Erech with the enamoured Enkidu, while
 she relates to him the two dreams of the king, Gilgamish. In these
 dreams which he has told to his mother he receives premonition
 concerning the advent of the satyr Enkidu, destined to join with him in
 the conquest of Elam.
 
 Now the harlot urges Enkidu to enter the beautiful city, to clothe
 himself like other men and to learn the ways of civilization. When he
 enters he sees someone, whose name is broken away, eating bread and
 drinking milk, but the beautiful barbarian understands not. The harlot
 commands him to eat and drink also:
 
 “It is the conformity of life,
 
 Of the conditions and fate of the Land.”
 
 He rapidly learns the customs of men, becomes a shepherd and a mighty
 hunter. At last he comes to the notice of Gilgamish himself, who is
 shocked by the newly acquired manner of Enkidu.
 
 “Oh harlot, take away the man,” says the lord of Erech. Once again the
 faithful woman instructs her heroic lover in the conventions of society,
 this time teaching him the importance of the family in Babylonian life,
 and obedience to the ruler. Now the people of Erech assemble about him
 admiring his <<d0e265>>[[[#d0e265][210]]]godlike appearance. Gilgamish
 receives him and they dedicate their arms to heroic endeavor. At this
 point the epic brings in a new and powerful /motif/, the renunciation of
 woman's love in the presence of a great undertaking. Gilgamish is
 enamoured of the beautiful virgin goddess Išhara, and Enkidu, fearing
 the effeminate effects of his friend's attachment, prevents him forcibly
 from entering a house. A terrific combat between these heroes
 ensues,[[#d0e270][10]] in which Enkidu conquers, and in a magnanimous
 speech he reminds Gilgamish of his higher destiny.
 
 In another unplaced fragment of the Assyrian text[[#d0e278][11]] Enkidu
 rejects his mistress also, apparently on his own initiative and for
 ascetic reasons. This fragment, heretofore assigned to the second book,
 probably belongs to Book III. The tablet of the Assyrian version which
 carries the portion related on the new tablet has not been found. Man
 redeemed from barbarism is the major theme of Book II.
 
 The newly recovered section of the epic contains two legends which
 supplied the glyptic artists of Sumer and Accad with subjects for seals.
 Obverse III 28--32 describes Enkidu the slayer of lions and panthers.
 Seals in all periods frequently represent Enkidu in combat with a lion.
 The struggle between the two heroes, where Enkidu strives to rescue his
 friend from the fatal charms of Išhara, is probably depicted on seals
 also. On one of the seals published by Ward, /Seal Cylinders of Western
 Asia/, No. 459, a nude female stands beside the struggling
 heroes.[[#d0e292][12]] This scene not improbably illustrates the effort
 of Enkidu to rescue his friend from the goddess. In fact the satyr
 stands between Gilgamish and Išhara(?) on the seal.

 [[#d0e109src][1]] Ni. 13981, published by Dr. Poebel in PBS. V, No. 2.
 
 [[#d0e115src][2]] The local Bêl of Erech and a bye-form of Enlil, the
 earth god. Here he is the consort of the mother goddess Ninsun.
 
 [[#d0e122src][3]] Tammuz is probably a real personage, although
 /Dumu-zi/, his original name, is certainly later than the title /Ab-ú/,
 probably the oldest epithet of this deity, see /Tammuz and Ishtar/,
 p. 8. /Dumu-zi/ I take to have been originally the name of a prehistoric
 ruler of Erech, identified with the primitive deity Abu.
 
 [[#d0e166src][4]] See /ibid./, page 40.
 
 [[#d0e177src][5]] Also Meissner's early Babylonian duplicate of Book X
 has invariably the same writing, see Dhorme, /Choix de Textes
 Religieux/, 298--303.
 
 [[#d0e190src][6]] Sign whose gunufied form is read /aga/.
 
 [[#d0e210src][7]] The standard text of the Assyrian version is by
 Professor Paul Haupt, /Das Babylonische Nimrodepos/, Leipzig, 1884.
 
 [[#d0e219src][8]] The name of the mother of Gilgamish has been
 erroneously read /ri-mat ^{ilat}Nin-lil/, or /Rimat-Bêlit/, see Dhorme
 202, 37; 204, 30, etc. But Dr. Poebel, who also copied this text, has
 shown that /Nin-lil/ is an erroneous reading for /Nin-sun/. For /Ninsun/
 as mother of Gilgamish see SBP. 153 n. 19 and R.A., IX 113 III 2.
 /Ri-mat ^{ilat}Nin-sun/ should be rendered “The wild cow Ninsun.”
 
 [[#d0e249src][9]] The fragments which have been assigned to Book II in
 the British Museum collections by Haupt, Jensen, Dhorme and others
 belong to later tablets, probably III or IV.
 
 [[#d0e270src][10]] Rm. 289, latter part of Col. II (part of the Assyrian
 version) published in HAUPT, /ibid./, 81--4 preserves a defective text
 of this part of the epic. This tablet has been erroneously assigned to
 Book IV, but it appears to be Book III.

 --------------
 
 [[#d0e308src][1]] Here this late text includes both variants /pašāru/
 and /zakāru/. The earlier texts have only the one or the other.
 
 [[#d0e325src][2]] For /kakabê/; /b/ becomes /u̯/ and then is reduced to
 the breathing.
 
 [[#d0e339src][3]] The variants have /kima kiṣri/; /ki-[ma]?-rum/ is a
 possible reading. The standard Assyrian texts regard Enkidu as the
 subject.
 
 [[#d0e350src][4]] Var. /da-an/
 
 [[#d0e357src][5]] /ŠAM-KAK/ = /ilu/, net. The variant has /ultaprid
 ki-is-su-šu/, “he shook his murderous weapon.” For /kissu/ see ZA.
 9,220,4 = CT. 12,14b 36, /giš-kud/ = /ki-is-su/.
 
 [[#d0e377src][6]] Var. /nussu/ for /nuš-šu/ = /nušša-šu/. The previous
 translations of this passage are erroneous.
 
 [[#d0e391src][7]] This is to my knowledge the first occurence of the
 infinitive of this verb, /paḫēru/, not /paḫāru/.
 
 [[#d0e432src][8]] Text /ma/?
 
 [[#d0e444src][9]] /ištanamma/ > /ištilamma/.
 
 [[#d0e460src][10]] Cf. Code of Hammurapi IV 52 and Streck in
 /Babyloniaca/ II 177.
 
 [[#d0e521src][11]] Restored from Tab. I Col. IV 21.
 
 [[#d0e537src][12]] Cf. Dhorme /Choix de Textes Religieux/ 198, 33.
 
 [[#d0e553src][13]] /namaštû/ a late form which has followed the analogy
 of /reštû/ in assuming the feminine /t/ as part of the root. The long
 /û/ is due to analogy with /namaššû/ a Sumerian loan-word with nisbe
 ending.
 
 [[#d0e598src][14]] Room for a small sign only, perhaps /A; māi̭āk/? For
 /mâka/, there, see BEHRENS, LSS. II page 1 and index.
 
 [[#d0e631src][15]] Infinitive “to shepherd”; see also Poebel, PBS. V 106
 I, /ri-i̭a-ú/, /ri-te-i̭a-ú/.
 
 [[#d0e656src][16]] The text has clearly /AD-RI/.
 
 [[#d0e703src][17]] Or /azzammim/? The word is probably an adverb; hardly
 a word for cup, mug (??).
 
 [[#d0e715src][18]] /it/ is uncertain and /ta/ more likely than /uš/. One
 expects /ittabriru/. Cf. /muttabrirru/, CT. 17, 15, 2; /littatabrar/,
 EBELING, KTA. 69, 4.
 
 [[#d0e755src][19]] For /šapparu/. Text and interpretation uncertain.
 /uttappiš/ II² from /tapāšu/, Hebrew /tāpaś/, seize.
 
 [[#d0e803src][20]] Text /ta/!
 
 [[#d0e811src][21]] On /ekēšu/, drive away, see Zimmern, /Shurpu/, p. 56.
 Cf. /uk-kiš/ Myhrman, PBS. I 14, 17; /uk-ki-ši/, King, Cr. App. V 55;
 etc., etc.
 
 [[#d0e833src][22]] The Hebrew cognate of /mašû/, to forget, is /našâ/,
 Arabic /nasijia/, and occurs here in Babylonian for the first time. See
 also Brockelman, /Vergleichende Grammatik/ 160 a.
 
 [[#d0e857src][23]] Probably phonetic variant of /edir/. The preterite of
 /edēru/, to be in misery, has not been found. If this interpretation be
 correct the preterite /edir/ is established. For the change /r/ > /l/
 note also /attalaḫ/ < /attaraḫ/, Harper, /Letters/ 88, 10, /bilku/ <
 /birku/, RA. 9, 77 II 13; /uttakkalu/ < /uttakkaru/, Ebeling, KTA. 49
 IV 10.
 
 [[#d0e898src][24]] Also /na/-'-[     -]/ma/ is possible.
 
 [[#d0e920src][25]] The text cannot be correct since it has no
 intelligible sign. My reading is uncertain.
 
 [[#d0e923src][26]] Text uncertain, /kal-lu-tim/ is possible.
 
 [[#d0e938src][27]] /KAK-ši/.
 
 [[#d0e950src][28]] /KAK-ši/.
 
 [[#d0e967src][29]] Literally nostrils. /pitik apunnati-šu/, work done in
 his presence(?). The meaning of the idiom is uncertain.
 
 [[#d0e993src][30]] Text /ZU/!
 
 [[#d0e999src][31]] Text has erroneous form.
 
 [[#d0e1013src][32]] Text /PA-it-tam/ clearly!
 
 [[#d0e1021src][33]] Omitted by the scribe.
 
 [[#d0e1041src][34]] Sic! The plural of /kakku/, /kakkîtu/(?).
 
 [[#d0e1054src][35]] Cf. /e-pi-ša-an-šu-nu libâru/, “May they see their
 doings,” /Maḳlu/ VII 17.
 
 [[#d0e1072src][36]] For /šakin-šum/.
 
 [[#d0e1093src][37]] On the verb /nâku/ see the Babylonian Book of
 Proverbs § 27.
 
 [[#d0e1149src][38]] The verb /la'āṭu/, to pierce, devour, forms its
 preterite /iluṭ/; see VAB. IV 216, 1. The present tense which occurs
 here as /iluṭ/ also.
 
 [[#d0e1165src][39]] Note /BUL(tu-ku)/ = /ratātu/ (falsely entered in
 Meissner, SAI. 7993), and /irattutu/ in Zimmern, /Shurpu/, Index.
 
 [[#d0e1204src][40]] “For /ipšaḫ/.”
 
 [[#d0e1214src][41]] Sic! /ḫu/ reduced to the breathing /'u/; read
 /i-ni-'u/.

      1Gilgamish arose interpreting dreams,

      2addressing his mother.

      3“My mother! during my night

      9He bore a net but I was not able to bear it.

      10I summoned the land to assemble unto him,

      11that heroes might kiss his feet.

      12He stood up before me[[#d0e1292][1]]

      13and they stood over against me.

      14I lifted him and carried him away unto thee.”

      15The mother of Gilgamish she that knows all things,

      16said unto Gilgamish:--- <<d0e1303>>[[[#d0e1303][212]]]

      22Thou shalt spare him....

      23Thou shalt lead him to me.”

      24Again he dreamed and saw another dream

      25and reported it unto his mother.

      26“My mother, I have seen another

      27[dream. I beheld] my likeness in the street.

      28In Erech of the wide spaces[[#d0e1337][3]]

      29he hurled the axe,

      30and they assembled about him.

      31Another axe seemed his visage.

      32I saw him and was astounded.

      33I loved him as a woman,

      34falling upon him in embrace.

      35I took him and made him

      36my brother.”

       22and his javelin reposed.
       
       23He turned back his breast.
       
       24After he had turned back his breast,
       
       25Enkidu unto that one
       
       26spoke, even unto Gilgamish.
       
       27“Even as one[[#d0e1764][6]] did thy mother

       [[#d0e1457src][4]] /patāḳu/ has apparently the same sense originally as
       /batāḳu/, although the one forms its preterite /iptiḳ/, and the other
       /ibtuḳ/. Cf. also /maḫāṣu/ break, hammer and construct.
       
       [[#d0e1518src][5]] The passage is obscure. Here /šuḫuru/ is taken as a
       loan-word from suģur = ḳimmatu, hair of the head. The infinitive II¹ of
       /saḫāru/ is philologically possible.
       
       [[#d0e1764src][6]] I.e., an ordinary man.

      PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

      To protect the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting the free
      distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work (or
      any other work associated in any way with the phrase “Project
      Gutenberg”), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
      Gutenberg™ License available with this file or online at
      www.gutenberg.org/license.

      Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg™
      electronic works

      1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™ electronic
      work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to and accept
      all the terms of this license and intellectual property
      (trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all the
      terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy all
      copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your possession. If you
      paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project Gutenberg™
      electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the terms of this
      agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or entity to whom you
      paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

      1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be used
      on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who agree
      to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few things that
      you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works even without
      complying with the full terms of this agreement. See paragraph 1.C
      below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project Gutenberg™
      electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement and help
      preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. See
      paragraph 1.E below.

      1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the Foundation”
      or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
      Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual works in the
      collection are in the public domain in the United States. If an
      individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the United States and
      you are located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent
      you from copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating
      derivative works based on the work as long as all references to Project
      Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope that you will support the
      Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting free access to electronic works
      by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™ works in compliance with the terms
      of this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg™ name associated
      with the work. You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
      keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
      Gutenberg™ License when you share it without charge with others.

      1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
      what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are in
      a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States, check
      the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
      before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
      creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
      Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no representations concerning the
      copyright status of any work in any country other than the United
      States.

      1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

      1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
      access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear prominently
      whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work on which the
      phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the phrase “Project
      Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
      copied or distributed:

      #+begin_quote

      This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
      most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
      whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
      of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online at
      [[https://www.gutenberg.org][www.gutenberg.org]]. If you are not located
      in the United States, you will have to check the laws of the country
      where you are located before using this eBook.
      #+end_quote

      1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is derived
      from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not contain a
      notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the copyright
      holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in the United
      States without paying any fees or charges. If you are redistributing or
      providing access to a work with the phrase “Project Gutenberg”
      associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply either with
      the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or obtain permission
      for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™ trademark as set
      forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

      1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
      with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
      must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
      terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms will be linked
      to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works posted with the
      permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

      1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
      License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
      work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.

      1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
      electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
      prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
      active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
      Gutenberg™ License.

      1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
      compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
      word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access to or
      distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format other than
      “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official version
      posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website (www.gutenberg.org),
      you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
      copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
      request, of the work in its original “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other
      form. Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg™
      License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

      1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
      performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works unless
      you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

      1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing access
      to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works provided that:

      - • You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method you
        already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed to the
        owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has agreed to donate
        royalties under this paragraph to the Project Gutenberg Literary
        Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid within 60 days
        following each date on which you prepare (or are legally required to
        prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty payments should be clearly
        marked as such and sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
        Foundation at the address specified in Section 4, “Information about
        donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.”
      - • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he does
        not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™ License. You
        must require such a user to return or destroy all copies of the works
        possessed in a physical medium and discontinue all use of and all

      - • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
      - • You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.

      1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg™
      electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set forth
      in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from the
      Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of the

      1.F.

      1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
      effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
      works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
      Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
      electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
      contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
      or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
      property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
      computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by your
      equipment.

      1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
      of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
      Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
      Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
      Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all liability
      to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal fees. YOU AGREE
      THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, BREACH OF
      WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.
      YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR
      UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT,
      INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE
      NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

      1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a defect
      in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can receive
      a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a written
      explanation to the person you received the work from. If you received
      the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with your
      written explanation. The person or entity that provided you with the
      defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
      refund. If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
      providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
      receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If the second copy
      is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
      opportunities to fix the problem.

      1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
      in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
      WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
      WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

      1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
      warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
      If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
      law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
      interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
      the applicable state law. The invalidity or unenforceability of any
      provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

      1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
      trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
      providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in accordance
      with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
      promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works,
      harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
      that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
      or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg™
      work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
      Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any Defect you cause.

      Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

      Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
      electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
      including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists
      because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
      people in all walks of life.

      Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
      assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™'s goals
      and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will remain freely
      available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg
      Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and
      permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future generations. To learn
      more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how
      your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the
      Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

      Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
      Foundation

      The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
      501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the state
      of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue
      Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification number is
      64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
      Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by U.S.
      federal laws and your state's laws.

      Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
      Archive Foundation

      Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
      public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the
      number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely
      distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest array of
      equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to
      $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with
      the IRS.

      The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
      charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
      States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
      considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
      with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where
      we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
      DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
      visit [[https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/][www.gutenberg.org/donate]].

      While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
      have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
      against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
      approach us with offers to donate.

      International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any
      statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside
      the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

      Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
      methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways
      including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate,
      please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

      Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

      Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg™
      concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
      with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
      Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

      Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
      editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
      the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
      necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

      Most people start at our website which has the main PG search facility:
      [[https://www.gutenberg.org][www.gutenberg.org]].

      This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™, including
      how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
      Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to
      our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
